Explanation of Key Components:

main.py: Sets up the Qt application instance, creates the MainWindow from ui/main_window.py, and starts the event loop.

config.json / core/state_manager.py: Handles saving and loading user preferences and application state (Phase 5).

resources/: Stores static files like icons needed for the UI.

core/: Contains the non-UI logic. This separation makes the code more modular and testable.

audio_processor.py, text_processor.py: Handle file input and conversion logic (Phase 2).

stt_engine.py, tts_engine.py: Abstract the interactions with the ML models. The tts_engine.py is critical for Phase 3, especially getting timing data.

ui/: All PyQt/PySide related code.

main_window.py: The central hub for the UI, connecting buttons to actions in the core modules, displaying text, and managing the playback state (Phases 1, 3, 4).

widgets/, dialogs/: For reusable UI parts.

utils/: Shared helper functions or classes, like wrappers for running tasks in background threads (QThread) to keep the UI responsive (Used in Phases 2 & 3).

models/: A designated place if you choose to download/store the ML models locally alongside the application code. How models are loaded/managed depends heavily on the chosen libraries (transformers, openai-whisper, etc.).

temp/: For runtime-generated files like the WAV output from TTS. Ensure this isn't tracked by version control.

tests/: Essential for ensuring components work correctly, especially the core processing and engine interactions.

Development Workflow & Checkpoints:

Setup (Phase 1): Create this structure. Set up the virtual environment, install dependencies (requirements.txt), and get a basic, empty window showing using main.py and ui/main_window.py.

Checkpoint: Can you run python main.py and see an empty application window?

Input & Conversion (Phase 2): Implement file dialogs in ui/main_window.py. Wire them up to call functions in core/audio_processor.py and core/text_processor.py (using utils/threads.py for background processing). Implement the markitdown and basic Whisper logic (without full model loading yet if preferred, just the structure). Display some text output in the UI.

Checkpoint: Can you import a file/audio, trigger the processing (even if simulated), and see placeholder text appear in the main text area?

TTS & Playback Setup (Phase 3 - Part 1): Focus on integrating the Kokoro TTS engine in core/tts_engine.py. Can you synthesize speech from a simple hardcoded string? Crucially, investigate and confirm you can extract word timings. Set up QMediaPlayer in ui/main_window.py and the basic Play/Pause logic, playing back a test audio file initially.

Checkpoint: Can you synthesize speech from text? Can you play/pause a dummy audio file using the UI buttons? Have you confirmed a method for getting TTS timings?

Full TTS & Playback (Phase 3 - Part 2): Connect the text display content to the TTS engine. Implement the flow: get text -> synthesize (in thread) -> get audio + timings -> load into QMediaPlayer -> play.

Checkpoint: Can you load text (from Phase 2), press Play, hear the synthesized speech, and pause/resume it?

Highlighting & Interactivity (Phase 4): Implement the QTimer logic in ui/main_window.py. Use the timings obtained in Phase 3 to highlight text in the QTextEdit. Implement the setReadOnly logic based on playback state. Handle text edits during pause (triggering re-synthesis).

Checkpoint: Does the text highlight correctly as speech plays? Is the text box editable only when paused? Does editing text correctly trigger re-synthesis on the next play?

State Persistence (Phase 5): Implement core/state_manager.py and integrate it into main.py (on load) and ui/main_window.py (on close/change).

Checkpoint: Does the application remember the last file, TTS settings, and playback position when closed and reopened?

Refinement (Phase 6): Add error handling, polish the UI, optimize performance, write tests.

Checkpoint: Is the application robust? Does it handle errors gracefully? Is the performance acceptable?
