The Cult of the Black Cube

In his introduction to this book our author wastes  no time in pinpointing a major issue that has bugged occultism and the Western magical traditions for centuries if not millennia.When I'm asked what particular spiritual tradition I follow, I often have
to  resist  the  urge  to  say  "Saturnine  Gnosis,"  because  the  experiences,
rituals,  and practices that I follow are ultimately connected to chthonic
entities and their ruling Intelligence that fundamentally is not a good or
kindly being, namely the Saturnine deity.

Indeed,  the  term  'Saturnine  (or,  more  commonly:  Saturn)  Gnosis'  shares  its
ambiguity with  many  if not  most  occult  concepts  and  tags.  Whereas,  to  the
uninformed reader, its constituent elements ('Saturn,' 'Gnosis') may seem to be
straightforward enough, any closer in-depth look will reveal multiple different
layers  of meaning,  a good many of which  appear to  be  downright  contradic-
tory,  i.e.  incompatible, with one another. This has made  for a lot of bewilder-
ment and occasionally bitter disputes within the various  occult communities
throughout  the  ages,  with  little  effort  being  spent  on  analyzing  the  specific
factors -  philosophical, intellectual, societal, historical or, summarily, 'cultural'
- governing and fundamentally informing this intrinsic equivocation.

11

Thus,  many  occultists:  writers,  readers,  teachers,  acolytes,  and  practitio-
ners may be and indeed are aware that Saturn as a planetary deity symbolically
stands for the 'guardian of the threshold' as is the case, for example, in classical
astrology.  However,  this  epithet  does  not  easily  and  certainly  not  intuitively
comply with equating Saturn to the salvific figures of Lucifer (more commonly
a traditional denotation  of the  morning  and/or  evening  star,  i.e.  Venus)  and
Prometheus, not to mention the contrarian and -  to many -  sinister character
Satan, as a number of other schools and traditions are wont to do.

The  Greek term gnosis  in  turn  is  generally translated as  'knowledge.' This,
while  technically  accurate,  omits  to  address  the  fact  that  what  is  typically
implied  by  gnosis  within  a  philosophical  or  metaphysical  context  is  actually
knowledge  of a  revelatory and salvific  type  that  goes way beyond mere  intel-
lectual,  cognitive  ratiocination.  Contrary to  common  parlance,  where  it  may
stand for  basically any set of data  and information  (vide,  for  example,  coder
speak in information technology), in occultism it is imprinted by its reference
to antique Gnosticism -  an eminently ambiguous term in its own right whose
definition  has  been  and  actually  still  is  subject  to  ongoing  furious  academic
debates  for the better  part of two  centuries -  longer,  in  fact,  if you choose  to
factor in the early Church fathers' contention and propaganda concerning the
Gnostics' purported 'hereticism.'

This  ambiguity  issue  is  nothing  new,  of course,  and  everyone  who  has
devoted  more  than  perfunctory  attention  to  the  history of occultism  is  basi-
cally  aware  of it.  Introductory works  dealing with  occult  disciplines  ranging
from alchemy and astral projection to astrology, from divination to geomancy,
Enochian Aethyrs,  the  Kabbalah,  ceremonial magic,  sorcery and shamanism,
from sex magic, sigil magic and success spells to talismantics, the Tarot, theur-
gy  et  cetera,  to  name  but  a  representative  selection,  will  usually  explain  the
concept  of symbols  as  inherently  ambivalent  markers  ill-suited  to  simplistic
one-size-fits-all interpretations.

Nevertheless,  this  theoretical  consensus  has  done  little  to  prevent  acrid
controversies  between  uncounted  occultist  factions  over  which  particular
exegesis  and,  by  inference,  day  to  day  handling  of any  given  set  of symbols
is  the  'true'  and  'legitimate'  one.  By way  of a  particularly  illustrative  case  in

12

point let's take a brief look at the Coins of the Tarot deck and the elements that
are  commonly  assigned to  them.  General  consensus,  widely accepted to  this
day and ranging back to the 19th century has it that, obviously being a symbolic
representation of money, the Coins should be attributed to the element Earth.
This  reflects  the  Victorian  rationale  of material  prosperity  invariably  culmi-
nating in the acquisition of'safe' and 'stable' real estate ('property proper' as it
were) -  a fundamentally feudalist view of economic prowess hailing back to a
predominantly agrarian, i.e. pre-industrial society.

Yet even  as  long ago  as the  19th century,  there was  one  notable  prominent
exception:  in his  seminal treatise Le Tarot des Bohémiens,  clef absolue des sciences
occultes  [Tarot of the  Gypsies.  The Absolute  Key  to  the  Occult Sciences]  of 1889  the
Spanish  born  French  occultist,  former  theosophist,  Martinist,  magician,
author and court adviser to the Russian tsar, Papus (i.e. Gérard Analect Vincent
Encausse,  1865-1916)  assigns  the  element  Air  to  the  tarot's  Coins.  While  he
doesn't bother much with explaining this decision,  it does appear to be  more
in accord with our contemporary post-industrial (and, arguably, even Marxist)
view  of money  as  a volatile  abstraction  characterized  by  an  essential  mobil-
ity  and  insubstantial  flightiness.  Whereas  it  may doubtlessly  be  deployed to
purchase and maintain tangible immovables such as Earth-related real estate,
landed property, landholdings and the like, money itself is,  at least within the
framework of this  specific  paradigm,  an  entity functionally distinguished by
its  ability to  move  about  from  one  owner to  the  other.  Only when  it  is  being
'spent,'  i.e.  transitioned  from  one  place  to  another,  can  it  actually  exert  its
power of facilitating commerce and exchange of goods and services.  Precious
metal based currency aside, money's 'value' is actually a consensually honored
promise as issued by whoever holds the prerogative of coinage - which places it
squarely in the elemental realm of Air. This, incidentally, is why, within a plan-
etary correspondence context, money is traditionally allotted to Mercury.

Nor is this elemental assignment merely an abstract,  academic conceit.  In
practical  money  spells,  when  conducting  ceremonial  magic  in  the  Hermetic
heritage  -   as,  for  example,  in  the  Golden  Dawn  tradition  -   it  makes  all  the
difference whether your operative rituals and magical formulas are technically
focused on money as governed by Earth or, alternatively, on money as relating

13

to Air.  Indeed,  most practitioners would argue that your results  are bound to
vary significantly, depending on which particular correspondence pairing you
happen to opt for.

One  might be  tempted to  argue  that  in  hindsight  Papus  has  proven  to  be
the  more  astute  and  'progressive/  'modern'  thinker  by  viewing  money  and
its  symbolic  representation  by  the  tarot's  Coins  in  a  manner  that  unhitches
the  previously  dominant  if not  reactionary  perspective  of politico-economic
power invariably being  rooted in  and legitimized by large-scale  landed prop-
erty. Certainly, in an age of post-industrial globalized cyber economy it makes
little sense to tie the power of finance to an agrarian view of wealth and pros-
perity.

Note,  however,  that  our point  here  is  not about which  of these  two  diver-
gent views is the 'correct' one. Attempting to attain to such an absolute conclu-
sion would in  itself constitute  an  obsolete  agenda no  longer  plausible within
the  context  of contemporary postmodern  relativism.  Long  gone  are  the  days
when  incontrovertible  absolute  'truths'  were  Western  societies'  common
staple, regardless whether they were based in Aristotelian logic, fundamental-
ist religious convictions as promoted by Judaism and Christianity,  in idolized
secularist rationalism as  celebrated by Age of Enlightenment philosophy and
humanism,  or,  in  the  19th  and  early to  mid-20th  century,  by  scientism,  philo-
sophical  materialism  and  its  positivist  offshoots.  Philosophy,  anthropology,
depth  psychology,  neurology,  sociology,  the  cognitive  sciences  and  last  but
not least quantum physics have done their part grinding away at the absolut-
ist  certainties  of yore.  Today,  it  is  only  religious  fundamentalists,  politically
reactionary,  revisionist  minds  and  the  educationally  challenged who  cannot
come  to  terms  with  the  domineering  point  of view  that,  philosophically  as
well as  scientifically, 'reality' is no objective absolute but,  rather,  a narrational
construct  subject to  a  slew of factors  of which  supposedly objective  'facticity'
however defined is a mere subset.

Why  is  this  important  to  point  out?  Because  embracing  it  will  actually
expand  rather  than  limit  the  occult  practitioner's  options.  This  is  essentially
the  attitude  of Pragmatic  and,  to  an  extent,  even  Chaos  Magic:  don't  waste
precious time  and effort on determining invariably contestable  absolutes not

14

to mention provoking the ensuing overly theoretical metaphysical arguments
and  squabbling.  Rather,  if it works,  simply make  use  of it!  And be  as  flexible
about things as you can: if, in your money spell, you need to focus on the tangi-
ble,  material side  of both  money in  general and the tarot Coins  in  particular,
e.g. as in getting hold of a specific piece of real estate, by all means assign the
element Earth to either of them. Looking for success in some Forex online day
trading venture?  Perhaps  addressing  matters  via  the  elemental  paradigm  of
Air may prove to be the more promising approach.

Saturn  Gnosis  is  no  exception  and this  book elucidates  the  issue  in  abun-
dant, enlightening detail. The very title of Liz Greene's astrology classic Saturn:
A New Look at an Old Devil (originally published in 1976) illustrates the inevitable
ambiguity we will have  to  confront when  addressing the  mythological  figure
of Saturn  and  all  it  stands  for.  In  classical  astrology  and  its  many  iterations
right until  about the  middle  of the  20th  century,  Saturn  is  generally the  indi-
cator of famine, disease, misfortune, desolation, decrepitude, destitution and
death,  the  folkloristic  Grim  Reaper's  scythe constituting but a baleful echo of
Saturn's notorious  sickle. An  archetypal malefactor if there ever was one -  'old
devil' indeed. Saturn is, of course, the name the Romans assigned to the Greek
Titan  Kronos.  Not a particularly nice  fellow,  certainly not a 'good and kindly
being' by any standard -  if in doubt,  ask his  father Uranus whom he emascu-
lated with his scythe... The concatenation  (likely facilitated by their respective
names' similarity)  of the Titan  Kronos with the  god Chronos who personified
Time led to Saturn being rendered as 'Father Time' to the present day. And of
course, Time as the 'devourer of life' isn't exactly regarded as the most jovial of
cosmic cheer makers, either.

Yet, from a certain point (albeit not from very early on when they apparent-
ly still focused on his maleficent aspects) the Romans revered and worshipped
Saturnus as a benign deity in charge of agriculture, fertility, nourishment and
prosperity.  According  to  Ovid  and  Hesiod,  he  even  presided over  the  mythi-
cal Golden Age when all was well with the world and its human denizens. The
Capitoline  Hill was  originally  referred  to  as  Satumius  mons  and  the  god was
also in charge of the all-important state treasury. Rome's most popular annual
festival, the Saturnalia, was decidedly an extended period of making merry, of

15

present-giving  and playful social role  reversals  -  in  modern Western  cultural
terms we might well compare it to a mix of Carnival and Christmas festivities.
In summary, Saturn also enjoyed devotion and reverence as a prime divine
benefactor.  One  and the  same  entity,  viewed  as  both  the  incorporation  of evil
events,  depression  and  destruction  and  as  the  source  of wholesome  abun-
dance, well-being and revelry -  it doesn't get more contradictory than that.

Yet ours is not merely a question of "seeing both sides of the medal" or balanc-
ing the Yin with the Yang. Finagle it philosophically as much as you will: what
we are actually dealing with here is something very much alien to our purport-
edly clear cut, assertedly rational view of a one-truth-only-world as conveyed to
us by Aristotle and his successors. We are, in fact, dealing with the Power of the
Paradox. Mythical reality is never (and neither is life itself)  as unequivocal and
unambiguous as mainstream human endeavor would like to paint it. Gnosis as
an applied and manifest knowledge of life and life technology will always focus
not on "resolving” the obviously prevalent contradictions informing the world
but,  rather,  on handling them in a meaningful constructive manner:  practice
rather than dogma, palpable experience in lieu of abstract faith or merely theo-
retical  surmise  are  its  mainstay.  If nothing  else,  this  is  what  the  Gnostics  of
Antiquity and the  medieval mystics  and kabbalists  have taught us,  as  did the
Indian sages in Vedic times and the Buddhist masters: if we truly want to come
to grips with the world as is, we have no choice but to embrace its paradoxical
nature and forge it into a viable weapon to best the vagaries of life.

The  German Fratemitas Satumi  (FS)  is unquestionably the oldest and most
influential  magical  order  extant  focused  on  Saturn  Gnosis.  Thus,  it  seems
reasonable to assume that it may know a thing or two about the subject. The FS
holds antique Gnosticism in high esteem and has even devoted one of its work-
ing (as in contrast to honorary) degrees, the 25° Magister Gnosticus to the inves-
tigation and pursuit of gnosis. What many beginners find confusing, however,
is that while antique Gnosticism viewed the "Demiurge” as a malevolent or, at
best, ignorant entity which the Gnostics opposed in any which way, in its core
rituals  Saturn  is  addressed  as  the  "Great  Demiurge”  in  a  decidedly  positive,
respectful manner. How can this be? Isn't this a fundamental contradiction in
dire need of resolution?

16

Again, we are confronted with an ambiguity of terms that reflects the para-
doxical -  or dare we say holistic? -  narrative occultists in general and magicians
in  particular  are  bound  to  resort  to  and  handle  (rather  than  "resolve”)  when
dealing  with  the  vast  spectrum  of tools  a  plethora  o f occult  traditions  have
bequeathed to us. Obviously, in Plato's Timaeus (appr. 360 b c )  the Demiurge as
a universal artisan, master builder or fashioner, albeit essentially a secondary,
executory force, is an entity viewed as a great benefactor. After Plato, both the
Middle Platonic as well as the Neoplatonic schools of philosophy, while merrily
expounding on it, were entirely happy with the notion, too. As, incidentally, are
today's Freemasons, never mind the fact that they may not technically employ
the term "demiurge” itself any longer, having replaced it with "Great Architect
[of the Universe]”. The fundamental concept is still the same.

It was  the  antique  Gnostics who  converted the  expression  in  a  pejorative
manner  to  denote  a  lesser  being  or  archon  whose  various  -   distinctly  unfa-
vorable - appellations include Ialdabaoth,  Saklas  ("fool”),  Samael ("blind god”)
etc. Here we find the Demiurge being described as a malevolent, stupid, blind,
haughty, callous, egotistical if not unredeemable "failed god”, given which it is
the Gnostic's prime task to unmask him for what he is and to escape from his
profane  clutches.  This  is  part  and parcel  of the  Gnostics'  dualist  anti-cosmic
tenet that the world constitutes the dungeon of the nous or the "divine spark”
that needs liberation. Viewed from this perspective,  Saturn Gnosis is actually
quite  aware  of those  less  than  benevolent "chthonic  entities  and their  ruling
Intelligence” mentioned above.

Again, there is no necessity whatsoever to subscribe to either the one or the
other view to the exclusion of its  respective counterpart.  Rather, we would be
well-advised to handle them all in accordance with the English sorcerer Austin
Osman Spare's sober counsel that belief is but a technology which is why magi-
cians  should select their beliefs just as  surgeons will select their tools -  what-
ever is best suited to achieve any given goal is always the instrument or belief
of choice.

This book is an excellent resource to fill your metaphysical and philosophi-

cal arsenal with a multitude of such tools that will help empower you.

Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;

Now comes the final era of the Sibyl's song;
The new world order is born.
And now justice returns, Saturn's reign returns,
Now a new lineage is sent down from high heaven.

his book is going to explain some concepts which my friends and colleagues
warn  me  might  sound very bleak  to  first  time  readers.  That's  a very  fair
assessment.  When  I'm  asked  what  particular  spiritual  tradition  I  follow,  I
often have to resist the urge to say 'Saturnine Gnosis', because the experiences,
rituals, and practices that I follow are ultimately connected to chthonic entities
and their ruling Intelligence that fundamentally is not a good or kindly being,
namely the  Saturnine  deity.  Explaining  myself or  my views  and  practices  is
often more trouble than it's worth, and frankly, for years I didn't feel any incli-
nation to codify or  share them with anyone  else.  However,  in the last several
years,  a series  of events,  coincidences,  and synchronicities  have  run together
in such a way that I believe that the  Saturnine deity wishes these things to be
shared,  and so  I'm going to try to relate a series of occult teachings and tech-
niques, gathered from over 20 years of serious academic and esoteric research.
Since we're going to be spending some time together, I want to tell you a little
about myself, and why this book came to be written by me.

When  I was  in  my senior year of high  school,  I was  in  a car  accident that
damaged my  spine  and  crippled me  in  my  right leg.  X-rays  showed that the
section of my spine which connected to my hips -  the coccyx -  had been nearly
destroyed.  I was  in terrible,  constant pain, which stayed with me throughout
daylight  hours,  and  made  it  nearly  impossible  to  sleep,  study,  or  even  move

21

without  considerable  medication.  Sitting was  agony,  and the  damage  to  my
spine had caused a loss  of control over one  of my legs,  so  I  could only hobble
around school with the use o f a cane. This damage lasted for several years. The
medical  system was  good  and  efficient,  but  none  of the  treatments  worked,
and  my  spinal  specialist  was  concerned  that  surgery  had  a  good  chance  of
damaging the nerves further, and could lead to total paralysis below the waist.
I spent months in physiotherapy, then chiropractic - 1 even tried yoga. None of
these helped, and my doctors were forced to prescribe increasingly large doses
of opiates to dull the constant pain in my back and legs. That alone was almost
as  great a danger  as  the  nerve  damage,  because  opiates  are  highly addictive,
and this was at a time when painkiller addiction was not yet recognized as the
serious issue that it is today. I was 18 years old, and walking with a cane, but the
real issue was the vacillation between extremes of pain from the spinal damage
or the foggy vagueness o f morphine.

This miserable state of affairs lasted until I was midway through my under-
graduate studies. To be honest, Tm not entirely sure how I even got into univer-
sity,  as  I was  so heavily medicated that I  couldn't drive,  and often  slurred my
words. On the other hand, I really liked the process of learning, and university
offered the possibility of discovering the unknown.

My undergraduate studies were initially in  Humanities,  and I took a lot of
courses in different disciplines to see what I might want to do as a career. The
university was medium sized and had decent course offerings across a range
of disciplines, and so I was able to try psychology and philosophy, together with
Latin,  and  religious  studies.  I  thoroughly  enjoyed  religious  studies,  because
the department of religion was going through a generational transition, which
resulted  in  many  of the  faculty  being  specialists  in  ‘new*  fields  like  pagan-
ism and esoterica. They offered courses on 'Death and Dying', 'Magic and the
Occult',  and 'Ancient Myths and Semiotics',  none of which had been offered a
decade prior.

On  a whim,  I  signed up  for  the  course  on  'Magic  and the  Occult';  I  think
because I needed an elective, it fit my timetable, and it seemed interesting. So
I limped to class, and it turned out that the instructor was actually quite good,
and seemed to have what even today I would call an excellent non-specialist's

22

grasp of the subject matter. Just to be clear, I don't believe that someone needs
to be a magician in order to research magic, because there are some excellent
researchers  who  work  on  supernatural  phenomena without  trying  to  create
them. This was  one  such teacher,  and so we  had very interesting discussions
about the history of magic, magic in the ancient world, the mechanics of spells
and ceremonies,  and basic  demonology. As you can  see,  I  still remember the
course well, and since I was drugged into a nearly constant coma, that suggests
that it was a course well taught.

As  the  middle  of the  term  neared,  the  instructor  reminded us  that  as  per
the  syllabus,  we would not have  a  final  exam,  but instead a  research  project.
I  decided to  do  my essay on  the  concept of Black  Magic  in Antiquity,  mainly
because  I was  a  fan  of the  'Conan'  movies with Arnold  Schwarzenegger,  and
the whole 'ancient sorcerer' motif that was prevalent in that genre. So I spent a
few days in the university library, digging into different texts on necromancy,
black magic,  curses,  demons,  and materials  of that  sort.  It was very interest-
ing to see what was available back then,  and I must say that our library had a
surprisingly decent  collection  of books  and journals  on  those  subjects,  espe-
cially given that it wasn't a huge university.  I can only assume that the faculty
themselves were very active in research, which would have justified the sizable
collection of materials on those subjects.

I  was  poring  through  one  of the  French  monographs  on  la  nigromantie
romaine  (Roman necromancy) when I came across a particular ceremony that
was  designed to  placate  the  chthonic  gods  in  exchange  for  favors.  It was,  if
you know anything about Roman religion, a very typically Latin idea: do ut des,
meaning,  'I  give  so  that You  [the  deity]  will  give.'  The  ceremony was  rather
complex,  and it seemed to be based partially on the chthonic ritual celebrated
by Aeneas  in the Aeneid,  in which a ditch is dug so that black-colored animals
can be  sacrificed and have their blood flow down into the earth.  Reading it,  I
felt a  strange  sense  that maybe  these  practices were  not simply superstition.
The  ancients  were  not  stupid  people,  and you  absolutely  cannot  visit  Egypt
or  Italy or  India  and think that the  great  monuments  were  built by morons.
Magical  ceremonies  were  incredibly  costly  to  perform,  and  people  do  not
repeatedly spend large amounts of money on practices that generate no results.

23

In all of the ancient cultures, magicians were professionals, with clientele just
as  respectable  as  a  doctor  or  lawyer  might  envy.  With  this  in  mind,  I  found
myself contemplating the possibility of trying some modernized version o f the
ritual to the chthonic gods.

To be clear, I'm not saying that I believed in magic necessarily, but I was in
a kind of pain that can only be described as transformative. Everything around
me was visible only through a red haze, and I was losing my ability to function
in  any productive way. Through the  different courses  I was  taking,  though,  I
was  hearing  intelligent,  articulate  instructors  discussing  magic  as  an  actual
force that could be  studied,  tested,  and used to  real effect.  It's  not that those
teachers  were  (all)  claiming  to  be  magicians,  but that  they would  frequently
describe  having  observed  some  otherwise  unexplainable  phenomena  while
staying with  Native  American  medicine  men,  African  witchdoctors,  or  Sufi
masters.  They didn't  sugar  coat  it  either -  and this  stayed with  me -  they all
made a point of saying that magic was  a force that tended to  scar the  people
who used it,  and that those who contact the  spirit world tended to be  sick or
damaged individuals. This even has an academic name: The Shamanic illness/
because  most cultures  that have  shamans  believe  that the  spirits  contact the
potential shaman during some terrible sickness,  or after an accident of some
kind.  In any event,  given the kind of education that I'd been fortunate to get,
and since  I had exhausted all the conventional medical options,  I was willing
to try anything.

You might wonder: why approach the chthonic gods? The answer is simply
that I have always felt a natural resonance with chthonic energies. It's not that
I  liked  serial  killers  or war  zones,  but  in  the  mythology classes  that  I  took,  I
was  definitely drawn to the  more  savage  and monstrous  elements -  it wasn't
a rational liking, it was just instinctive. Furthermore, when you actually study
the  Hellenistic  or  Hermetic  magical traditions,  there  is  a  definite  sense  that
there  is  a  cosmic  order which  cannot  or  should  not  normally be  overturned.
If you're  injured and broken, you're  supposed to  consult a doctor or a priest,
you don't turn to magic unless you're willing to incur serious debt to powerful
gods or spirits. That may not be the way magic is discussed today, but that was

24

very much how it was presented in the various textbooks available to me at the
time.

I  did my research.  I  had taken  Latin,  and I was  able to reconstruct a basic
ritual that ought to have put me in touch with the Di Manes, the ghost-gods of
the  Roman netherworld. This seemed like a wise direction to go in,  because  I
knew for a fact that I have  Roman ancestry,  and in theory my ancestors must
have  sacrificed to these entities  for centuries. As  a blood descendant of some
presumable pious Romans, it made sense to approach those same entities and
ask for their help. I understood that magic involves trade, and so I was prepared
to offer virtually whatever they asked for.

The  night of the  ritual came,  and I  had prepared very carefully.  The  ritual
text itself was in  Latin, and I had relied partially on John Gager's Curse Tablets
and  Binding  Spells  for  some  of the  passages.  The  altar  had  offerings  of wine,
water,  bread,  and  other  gifts  that  seemed  representative  of the  traditional
things  that a  Roman  chthonic  entity might want. As  I  did not have  a funeral
pit to  pour them  into,  I  had procured a  glass  bowl to  receive  the  offerings.  I
myself had a toga, and I knew enough to cover my head to show humility to the
deities.  I began the ritual in the dark, except for a few candles to give enough
light to see the text. It was just the beginning of Fall, and so the house was rela-
tively warm. I recited the litany, and began to pour the offerings of wine, then
water, then bread. Using a knife, I then cut my left hand and allowed the blood
to trickle down my fingers and into the cauldron.

That particular act was probably one of the most significant o f my life.
Things began to change when the blood entered the cauldron. The tempera-
ture in the room dropped sharply, and the candles dimmed. The flames them-
selves  didn't  flicker,  but their  light became  so weak that the  darkness  of the
room was really oppressive.  I became aware that I was not alone -  I could feel
the  presence  of multiple  spirits  in  the  room with  me,  and they did not  at  all
feel friendly. I'd assumed that since I was drawing on ancestral gods and freely
offering my own blood that whatever showed up would be  friendly.  Stupidly,
I had not imagined that whatever came would be malevolent or just angry at
being disturbed.

25

Then the glass cauldron exploded. It didn't crack, it literally detonated into
tiny glass  fragments.  I  felt real fear,  because  I  didn't know what to do  at that
point.  It became hard to breathe,  as if some force was crushing my chest.  My
carefully planned Latin broke down, and I could only pray audibly in my native
French to those spirits to forgive me for having disturbed their slumber. I was
afraid to  move,  because  the  floor was  in  darkness,  and there were  tiny  glass
shards everywhere.

Eventually,  maybe  after  ten  or  fifteen  minutes,  the  malevolent  presence
in  the  room  faded  away.  The  room  became  warmer  and  brighter,  and  I  felt
that it was  safe  enough to limp  across the  room  and turn  on the  lights.  I  cut
my feet on the  glass,  of course, because  I had been barefoot.  I  cleaned up the
mess,  regretted having tried the ritual in the first place,  and promised myself
I'd never dabble in black magic again.

Two or three nights later, I had a lucid dream. It was unique, I'll never forget
it. Always I have hated trying to describe this dream, because it was a genuinely
sacred experience, but I am convinced that the rest of the book will simply not
make sense if I don't share the core aspects of it.

I  appeared on  a  mountain  in  this  really strange  place,  mostly desert,  and
the colors were all wrong,  namely that the  sky and sands were  all hues of red
and orange that are not possible on earth. There was a sense of hostility toward
life in that place.  But I did not really pay much attention to the surroundings,
because there was this gigantic pulsing black energy mass before me. It occa-
sionally  rippled with  color  in  the  same  way that  black  petroleum  can  have  a
rainbow sheen on its oily surface, and you know that the color is not the petrol,
it's  just the  light  glancing  off it.  The  black  energy spoke  to  me  by  projecting
words into my head,  I didn't question the mechanism at the time. In essence,
it said that my ritual had gotten its attention, and that it had decided to bring
me to its world. The deity offered me a choice. First, it said that I could return
to  my normal life,  and expect to  live  in  the  same  continued pain  and misery
that  had  compelled  me  to  try  something  as  desperate  as  dabbling  in  black
magic.  But  alternately,  it  said that  it  could  fix  me,  stitch  my damaged  spine
back together, and completely devour the trauma. The deity said that it would
do more than this -  it would set me on a different path than fate had intended,

26

where  I  would  go  interesting  places,  learn  to  do  strange  things,  and  have  a
generally very exciting life. In return, I would serve as one of its messengers in
this world, carrying its essence with me, running through the damaged tissues
of my body. My own agendas and ambitions would come second, because noth-
ing in life is free, and certainly not miracles.

Well,  I  wanted  to  experience  the  miraculous,  so  I  accepted  its  generous
offer without blinking. Right there and then, I felt its energy pour into me, like
ice water in my veins. I felt its essence crawling into my spine, like the steroid
injections  I'd  had,  working  its  way between  the  cracked vertebrae.  It  hurt  a
great deal, and then I woke up.

I'll keep  this  short:  within  a week,  the  pain  in  my spine was  gone.  In  two
weeks, I didn't need the cane to walk anymore, and within a month I no longer
needed any of the staggering amount o f medication that had previously allowed
me to function. My doctors had absolutely no explanation for the healing, and
they called it (you can rightly imagine) a miracle case.

It would be exciting to say that I began to receive razor-clear gnosis or direc-
tions,  but that's  not at  all how things worked for  me.  It  communicated with
me through  nudges,  surges  of intuitions,  and a lot of unusual  synchronicity.
Eventually, when  I was  ready, the deity finally allowed me to see it as  Saturn,
the Black Cube, the Lord of Time.  It didn't ever seem to give me any work, but
it did force me into graduate school,  and eventually into a doctorate program
in mythology at an Ivy League school. I have been studying the various cults of
Saturn, in His many cultural guises and manifestations ever since.

You might be interested to know that it has not been a solitary road. Along
the way, I have met a number of figures whom I studied with for a time. Each,
in  their  own  way,  was  and  is  a  deeply devoted  adept  of the  Saturnine  deity.
Some  of them  are very public  figures,  and it would  surprise you if you knew
that they were devotees of Saturn.  Others have proven to be allies who  (I was
shocked) have had similar experiences, and wandered on other equally or more
bizarre Saturnine quests.

Twenty-five years later, I have to say that the deity held up every part of its
agreement. Those years of study and practice have paid off, and I now enjoy a
level of privacy and comfort that many of my academic colleagues would envy.

27

Nevertheless,  in the  last year,  the  deity called Saturn has  made  it clear to me
(though  I  was  reluctant)  that  it  is  finally  time  to  write.  I  had  discussed  this
initially with my friend David Beth, who encouraged me in this direction.

I  don't like writing about the  occult for two  reasons.  One,  because  it  feels
wrong  to  share  secrets  and  insights  so  freely with  strangers.  Since  I  had  to
work hard for over two decades,  suffer,  travel,  and starve  in  order to  get this
knowledge, why would I  put it in  a book for other people?  Second,  and more
importantly,  because  these  practices,  this  knowledge,  is  deeply personal  and
sacred; And often this knowledge and the experiences derived from Saturnian
contact  are  intimate  beyond  conceptualization.  There  is  a  great  danger  that
any  attempt  made  to  convey  conceptually  what  is  basically  beyond  concep-
tualization  is  bound to  fail or at least is  in  danger to be  either  inadequate  or
misunderstood.  I do not want this to happen at all, and so if it were up to me, I
just would not write this book at all. Yet as I said above, some decisions are not
mine to make,  and so I hope that you will prove an understanding and atten­
tive audience.

This book is written for the Saturnine deity, in hopes that you too will find
something  special  here.  This  book  does  offer  secrets,  gleaned  from  years  of
study.  It  shows  rites  and practices  that  are  likely thousands  of years  old, yet
which  remain viable  and potent today.  Finally,  this  book  can  help you to  see
the incredible  intricacies to which this deity is  at work in the world,  in  many
cultures  and  enterprises.  Through  this  book,  I  hope,  you will  find your  own
way to the Saturnine deity, and what happens when you reach that point is up
to you.  Of course,  even  Saturn  is  himself a  manifestation  of an  even  greater
continuum  -  that  is,  Chaos  -  but we  will  get  to  that  in  time.  In  any  case,  if
somehow this  book  is  useful  in  your  own  spiritual  quest  for  the  gnosis  that
leads to primordial Chaos, then I will count my efforts well rewarded.

28

Overview

This book presents an overview into the worship and gnosis of the Saturnine

deity,  sometimes  called the  Black  Sun  or the  Black Cube,  a unique  entity
that has been venerated by many cultures for thousands of years. It is intended
primarily to be  used by practicing occultists,  but is  designed to  be  accessible
also  to  insightful  readers  of other backgrounds.  For the  purposes  o f nomen-
clature, this work refers to the god as 'the Saturnine deity' rather than Saturn,
primarily because 'Saturn' is  merely the  Roman name for an entity that tran-
scends the limitations of Italic mythology. Names are important, to be sure, but
in the case of a deity that has multiple names, it may be better to avoid naming
it consistently after a single cultural norm. As the author of The Picatrix makes
plain,  Him  which  someone  calls  'Saturn,'  another  may  call  'Cronos,'  'Sani,'
'Samedi,' 'Keyvan,' 'Tezcatlipoca,' or even 'the Black Cube.' This deity has been
treated  by  various  authors  from  their  own  unique  cultural  perspective.  For
example, the reader may be aware of The Greatness of Saturn by Robert Svoboda.
Other authors have addressed the Saturnine deity indirectly, or included Him
among  other  deities,  as  in  the  case  of (Pseudo)  Al-Majriti's  Ghayat al Hakim,
the translation o f which is better known in the West as the above-mentioned
Picatrix.  Nevertheless,  if one  accepts  for  a  moment that  the  occult  addresses
actual deities which themselves transcend cultural boundaries, then one must
acknowledge  that  a  culture-specific  approach  might  (or  indeed,  must)  have
limitations that are the result o f a culture's bias.

29

One of the most interesting occult exercises is the tracing o f the Saturn cult
throughout the various  cultures o f the  ancient world. This  exercise  is  signifi-
cant for several reasons. First, having studied five or six different ancient reli-
gious  systems,  it  becomes  clear  that  there  are very  few  deities  that  are  truly
international,  insofar  as  maintaining  their  distinct  traits  across  the  cultural
lines.  Saturn is one of the rare few who appears  in multiple cultures with the
same  essential  characteristics.  Here  one  might  ask  if all  solar  deities  aren't
generic  -   and  the  answer  would  be  definitively  'no/  The  Roman,  Aztec,  and
Egyptian  solar deities  (for example)  share almost nothing in  common  except
for the obvious attribute of the shining disk. One might equally ask if oceanic
deities  are  not  all  more  or  less  the  same,  and the  answer  there  is  again  'no/
they tend to be relatively unique apart from their connection to water.  In any
case, these aforementioned deities are tied to visible natural phenomena, and
so one would expect them to have common traits, since the observation of the
phenomena is not related to one's culture. When a deity or entity which repre-
sents more abstract concepts appears to carry those traits consistently across
the  cultural  lines,  it  raises  some  very  interesting  questions  of how  and why
the culture reveres that deity. In our modern esoteric culture we unfortunately
very  often  find  'practitioners'  insisting  that  a  figure  like  Lilith  is  equivalent
and non-different from Hecate and Kali, because they are female deities with
a dark side. This  is  an  incredibly poor  (and dangerous)  reduction  of complex
cultural figures and symbols. One must be careful not to simply 'lump togeth-
er' different deities  that share  a certain vague  portfolio  of attributes,  but not
distinguishing stories  or features. This book,  however, will demonstrate that
the Saturnine deity is not merely a series o f similar gods, but rather the same
entity which  is  recognized and venerated/placated by multiple  religions  and
occult systems.

This work presents its content across three thematic sections:

■   Scholarly Materials. There is a great deal of ancient, medieval, and
modern texts that deal with the mythology, worship, and veneration of
Saturn across a wide range of cultures. Predominate cultures covered
will include: Classical (Greco-Roman), Islamic, and Indian, with refer-
ences to Aztec and Afro-Caribbean spirituality where appropriate.
This section of the book investigates the way scholars and specialists
understand  the way various cultures perceived and experienced the
divine mandate and cosmic function o f Saturn. A selected annotated
bibliography which provides a discussion of sources for people who
wish to carry out their own independent investigations can be found at
the end of the book.

■   Saturnine Theory. This section investigates general discussions of
magic, and gnosis, together with personal views and knowledge gained
through direct transmission from mentors (human and inhuman)
about the Saturnine deity. It includes observations and speculations
about the global cult of Saturn in its many forms. Where the scholarly
section is backed by hard facts and academic sources, this section
is more gnostic, interpretive, and anecdotal than the prior one, but
equally significant in terms of the information presented.

■   Saturnine Practices. The contemporary cultist of Saturn has a very
wide range of historical practices from which to choose. This section
explores various basic and advanced devotions and rites, for those who
wish to engage directly with the Black Cube and its chthonic energies.
It also discusses some facets of contemporary occult practice, such as
the role o f sacrifice, the mechanics of Saturnine magic, and the ulti-
mate goal of the practice of magic.

Scholarly  Materials on Saturn

 Texts

Medieval  Islamic  cosmology,  like  the  Indian  and  Hermetic  cosmologies

from  which  it  borrows,  considers  that  the  seven  planets  of the  solar
system are  not mere  geological masses,  but physical representations of celes-
tial intelligences  or  powers.  These  seven  planetary powers  hold considerable
influence  over  the  day-to-day affairs  of humanity and indeed  all  earthly life.
Consequently, the serious student of celestial philosophy (read: magic)  is able
to  gain  some hold over these beings,  and thereby improve his lot on earth,  or
alter the course of natural events for another person, issue, or region.

In medieval Islamic esoterica, the figure of Saturn is a surprisingly popular
figure. The Arabic word for the Saturnine deity is Zuhal, which means The one
who  is  far  away',  or  'the  alien.' While  many  familiar with  Hermetic  thought
might like to  claim that this  concept o f  'distance' or 'being alien' is borrowed
from Greek thought, it has been definitively stated that 'Zuhal' was the Arabic
name for Saturn long before the Arabs or Jews had become familiar with Greek
learning.1

“This  etymology  clearly  postdates  the  knowledge  among Arabic  writers  o f Greek  cosmol-

ogy,  for  whom  Saturn  is  the  farthermost  planet  in  the  cosmos;  it  would  have  made  little

sense within  the  context o f the limited astronomy of the  pre-Islamic Arabs.”  See  Hartner-

[F.J.  Ragep],  “Zuhal”,  in:  Encyclopaedia  o f Islam,  Second  Edition,  Edited  by:  P.  Bearman,

As Islam lacks any outright 'Satanic' current, and its antinomian traditions
are much more 'Right Hand Path'2 than many would like to admit, the author
would  suggest  that  the  cult  of Zuhal took  the  role  that  Satanism  came  to  fill
in  medieval  Christianity.  The  Saturnine  deity  becomes  the  champion  of the
desperate, the greedy, the rebel, and the vengeance-driven. It is highly signifi­
cant that Zuhal appears  in multiple  Islamic  manuscripts,  and that the  details
of the  cult  of Zuhal  appear  to  have  been  well  known  to  Arab  authors  not  as
history,  but  as  actual  practices  which  'other Arabs' were  practicing well  into
the  medieval  period.  Zuhal  was  not  dimly  remembered  like  some  historical
Quraysh  deity such  as Allat  or  Hubal,  but was  instead held to  be  an  entity to
which  actual  sections  of the  Quran  were  dedicated,  and  to  whom  consider­
able  power of fate was  attributed.  This  tension  is  not  ignored by the  authors
of the various  esoteric  manuscripts,  and so  the  compilers  of The  Picatrix and
Nabataean Agriculture somewhat awkwardly try to turn the  planet Saturn  into
some sort of angelic intelligence, in the hopes of making its cult more palatable
to devout Muslim readers.

The various  manuscripts  insist,  on the  one  hand,  that Saturn  is  unique  in
that where the other planets have their own area of authority, Saturn's author-
ity is over the planets themselves, and so the devotee of Saturn has the advan-
tage of not only being able to appeal to Zuhal's own portfolio (discussed below),
but  also  the  possibility of using  Zuhal's  influence  to  overrule  the  other  plan-
etary powers.

When examining the Islamic view of the Saturnine deity, one would do well
to consider the source texts. One of the cardinal rules of any textual analysis is
that when authors mean something, they'll repeat themselves.  So in scanning
this text,  we will look first for  repetition,  not word order,  and terms  that are

2  By the  term 'Right  Hand  Path'  the  author  refers  to  a  spiritual tradition  that  is  in  keeping
with  the  orthodox norms  and taboos  o f a  given  religion,  in this  case  o f Islam.  Most forms

of Sufism  (for example)  would fall under this  definition,  as  they encourage  a strict adher-

ence to normative Islam.  By ‘Left Hand Path'  the author refers to those spiritual traditions

which deliberately ignore or even violate orthodox norms and taboos of a given religion. This

is  rare  in textual or folk  Islam,  though some  specialists  argue that  such  Sufi  groups  as the

Malamatiyya make use o f taboo violation as a kind o f shaming exercise that shocks the ego
into submission.

36

repeated will  be  flagged in  bold.  Since  the  text  is  in  translation,  it  is  reason-
able  to  consider  synonymic  repetition  as  valid.  As  the  oldest  of the  primary
texts considered in this section,  it would be wise to consider the words of Ibn
Wahshiyya's treatise Nabataean Agriculture. Ibn Wahshiyya writes of Zuhal:

Beware the evil of this god when He is angered or to the west of the Sun
or veiled in  its  rays in the middle of its  return.  Pray to  Him this prayer
which we have just given here. While you are praying this prayer,  give a
burnt offering to His idol consisting of old hides, grease, strips of leather
and dead bats. Burn for Him fourteen dead bats and an equal amount of
rats. Then take their ashes and prostrate yourself on them in front of His
idol. Prostrate yourselves to Him [in the form of ] a black stone on black
sand and seek refuge from Him against his evil, because O my brethren
and beloved ones,  He  is  the  cause  of the  perishing  of all that  perishes,
the cause of decay of all that decays, the cause of perdition of all that is
destroyed, the cause of sorrow of all the sorrowful ones, and the weeping
of all the weeping ones.  He is the  Lord of evil and sin and filth and dirt
and poverty.

This is what He does to men when He is angered, but when He is content
then  He  gives  them  existence,  long  life,  fame  after  their  death,  accep-
tance  in  the  eyes  of those  who  look  at  them  and  sweetness  of speech.
His anger is to be  [feared]  in  situations like  I just described to you,  but
his  contentment  is to be  expected when  He  is  east of the  Sun  or  in the
middle of His course or in places which agree with His actions or in the
full speed of His travel or in the cycle of His ascendance.

If you  pray  to  Him  when  He  is  angered,  repeat  your  prayer  and  the
sacrifice when  He is content and remind Him of the earlier prayer and
repeat it to Him so that you might escape his evil. 3

The  text continues,  but let us  pause  here  momentarily.  The text repeats  such
terms as 'evil,' 'anger,' 'prayer,' 'black.' These are not accidental repetitions, as the
author is trying to stress the nature of the deity. Zuhal is connected with 'evil.'
and is a power that can experience the emotional state that humans consider
'anger.'  This  suggests  two  things:  first,  that  Zuhal  has  emotions  as  a  human
and thus we can relate to Him on some level; second, that the deity is aware of
human action and reacts to it.  Further, the text repeats the verb 'pray' and the
noun 'prayer' several times, which indicates that it is possible to communicate
with this remote being, not as an equal, but as something greater. We also see,
for the first time, the reference to the veneration of Saturn using a black stone
to represent him. The examination of the repetition concluded, it is good now
to see what terms remain.

As  a  reminder,  these  words  of Ibn Wahshiyya  follow  a  traditional  incan-
tation  to  Zuhal.  The  text  leaves  no  room  for  misunderstanding,  as  he  clearly
identifies Zuhal as the source of evil, decay, destruction,  sorrow, and unclean-
ness. Ibn Wahshiyya expresses concern that Zuhal has a vindictive personality
and a bad temper.  Even the  offerings  to  Zuhal are  foul and uncouth -  rather
than gold or incense, He is to be offered 'old hides, grease, strips of leather and
dead bats/  It  is  important to  note while  hides,  grease,  and leather  are  rather
low  quality  goods,  the  dead  bats  are  actually  carrion,  that  is  filth  (najasa)  in
Islamic  law,  and  so  the  offering  of such  to  a  spirit  indicates  that his  charac-
ter is  sharply different  from  any of the  angelic  spirits  attributed to  the  other
planets, such as Jupiter or Venus. This places the spirit of Zuhal closer in reso-
nance to  the  terrestrial jinn, which  are  said to  be  attracted to the  dead,  filth,
and spilled blood.  It is  difficult to  stress this  in the  English language,  but the
use of carrion  is  a tremendous taboo  in  Islam -  even handling it necessitates
ablutions in  some schools of jurisprudence. Any mainstream Muslim reading
this  invocation would be justifiably shocked to  see that one would offer dead
bats to Zuhal. Ibn Wahshiyya continues:

Know  that  He  is  the  one  who  gives  success  in  cultivation  of the  earth
and  growth  or  its  opposite  to  plants;  He  revealed  to  the  Moon  what  I
put down in this book of mine and the Moon revealed it to His idol, and

38

I  was  taught  it  by the  idol  of the  Moon  just  like  I  now teach  it  to  you.
Preserve this because it is your life on which you rely and on it depends
the growth of your fields and your fruits which are the matter of your life
and your hope,  during your lifetime,  of comfort,  affluence,  safety,  and
complete health.

Know that  I  have  prayed to  this  god,  Saturn,  and  in  my  prayer  I  have
asked His  idol to benefit with this book of mine everyone who reads  it.
The  idol revealed to me:  Tour prayer has been heard and your offering
accepted.' I did this because I felt sorry for the sons of my kind because
of the  anguish  of their  poverty  and  the  abundance  of their  misery.
[Nabataean Agriculture, p. 151]

This section is very significant, because the author admits that he has person-
ally tried this particular spell, praying to a black stone idol, and that Zuhal has
directly spoken to him through the black stone. The term 'black stone' is delib-
erately evocative  of the  black  stone  in  Mecca  embedded  in  the  Kaaba.  As  an
educated Arab who uses Islamic language, Ibn Wahshiyya is deliberately push-
ing the envelope.

The Saturnine deity can be further understood through some of the prayers
directed towards it.  Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabataean Agriculture records a prayer to
Zuhal, which the Picatrix compiler both cites and includes in its entirety, indi-
cating that it was considered highly effective. The text is slightly strange, as it
wanders between the second person ('you') and the third person ('he'), but this
style is likely in imitation of the Quran which uses similar shifts of person. This
spell will  be  discussed  further  below  in  the  Third  Section  as  a  contemporary
magical operation. Yet for the moment,  it is  good to note  some of the charac-
teristics of the deity which the spell outlines. The text reads:

Oh Saturn, we address ourselves to You, standing, we ask and we honor
You with obedience and humility; we address You,  standing and facing
the exalted master, alive and eternal, solid in His power and dominion.
He is eternal in his heaven and mighty in his dominion, focused in His

39

efforts  and  His  great works.  He  is  over  all,  His power  is  over  all living
things on earth,  and they endure by His endurance.  By His power and
His might He began them,  and He causes them to continue;  He causes
us to endure, and by His eternity and perpetuity, He brings permanence
on earth. By His might, He causes the waters to ebb and flow. Living, He
causes life to move, because He is himself alive.

He  is  cold,  as  is  His  nature.  Through  the  influence  of His  high  realm,
the  trees  grow,  and the  earth  becomes  heavy under  the  weight  of His
movements; if He wishes, He causes beings to become what they are not.
Yet He is wise and a creator by His might and intelligence; His knowing
extends to all things.

The  text  is  lengthy,  so  it  is  good to  pause  again  here  for  analysis. As we  said
above,  the  cardinal  rule  of any  textual  analysis  is  that  when  authors  mean
something,  they'll  repeat  themselves.  With  this  in  mind,  we  note  the  repeti,'
tion of the terms 'eternal,' 'power,' 'endure,' and 'heavy/weight.' These suggest
a deity that is seen to be timeless or to have power over the course of time. It is good
to indicate here that these are not terms that are used of the other six planetary
gods, and since clearly those gods are quite ancient, we understand that Saturn
is 'ancient' in a truly cosmic sense. There are other significant terms here, but
we will continue the  review looking for  repetition. We  can  return  now to the
text to see what terms are repeated:

Hail,  lord  of the  heavens,  may Your  name  be  holy,  pure  and  honored.
We obey You; we address ourselves to Your ancientness, we call You by
Your  names,  Your  ancientness,  Your  nobility  and  honor.  We  demand
from You whom  we  respect  to  strengthen  our  mind,  that  it  be  strong
and enduring and dwell in us while we live. Then when we die, ward off
the worms  and reptiles  from  our flesh. You are a merciful  and ancient
teacher,  and no one can  save the one You condemn. You are  persistent
in  Your words  and  deeds,  and You  regret  not Your  acts.  You  are  slow
and  profound  in  Your  powers.  You  are  a  master  whose  deeds  cannot

40

be  undone,  and what You  forbid  cannot  be  done  by  another.  You  are
respected in  all Your actions  and unique  in Your kingdom. You are the
lord of the other planets, and the very stars fear the sound of Your move-
ment and tremble before Your gaze.

We ask and demand You to avert Your evil from us,  and in Your purity,
to treat us well.  By Your good and noble names, we avert Your evil, and
we  draw  from Your virtue.  By Your  names,  by Your True  Name which
You love more than the others, treat us well and grant what we ask.

Here,  the word 'endurance'  appears  again,  and 'ancientness.' There  is  a curi-
ous sort of paradox: Zuhal is said earlier in the spell to be eternal, yet later He
is  ancient  at  the  same  time.  How,  then,  can  an  eternal  being  be  'old'?  Being
'eternal' implies not experiencing the process of time, or being outside of time.
By 'ancient' then, the text must be stressing that the Saturnine deity is a truly
primordial entity, unlike the other younger gods who follow later. The text also
stresses  the  fact that the  Saturnine  deity is  a deity of hardiness  (endurance),
though it is the tirelessness of a grizzled veteran, rather than a young athlete.
Like an old man,  Saturn is heavy, sluggish, yet enduring.  His power is not the
flashy and quick magic of the  Sun or Mercury,  and it is likely not invoked for
fast results (where the other planets might be), but it is a lasting power.

If the reader suspects that the case for Saturn's malevolence has been over-
stated by the author, it would be wise to remember that the term 'evil'  (Arabic
sharr)  occurs  repeatedly across  several texts. Also,  the terms  'honor'  and 'evil'
appear  as  repeated terms  in  this very passage.  These  likewise  appear to  be  a
kind of contradiction: how can a being be evil, or the source of evil (as a related
text indicated above),  and yet be honorable? The  only possible  answer  is  that
in  the  medieval  mind,  a  deity or  person  could be  malevolent,  and yet have  a
code of honor, or at least some frame of reference which humans might possi-
bly understand.  Honor implies that the  deity will acknowledge  sacrifices  and
prayers made in its honor, and that it will react accordingly. Equally, it implies
that the deity may be  offended if it is  approached without the  proper respect
and humility. This point may be jarring to many contemporary occultists who

41

push for an anthrocentric narrative, but it is necessary to stress that most tradi-
tional spiritual or occult systems, while operating from  a human  standpoint,
have not placed Man at the sacred centre of their cosmology. If one accepts that
deities  (by whatever name)  are actual and independent beings, then attempt-
ing to approach them as equals is the very definition of hubris and/or stupid-
ity.  This  is  not  to  say  that  exclusive,  subservient worship  (in  the  Abrahamic
sense)  is  necessary to work with a deity, but by comparison,  one can  speak to
one's professional or political superior with deep and genuine respect, without
actually worshipping them.

Having  discussed those  aspects  of the  text which  are  repeated,  it  is  good
to  review those which  occur on  their  own.  Saturn  is  said to  be  cold,  and this
follows Islamic cosmology which holds that planets and living beings are 'hot'
or 'cold' by nature.4 Saturn is cold by nature, which could be because He is elder-
ly, or else because  He is a chthonic figure. The text also says that His power is
slow, but this suggests the relentless,  grinding power of a glacier -  it does not
move quickly, but there is nothing which can resist its momentum. Even more
significant is the line which  states: 'You are the lord of the other planets,  and
the very stars fear the sound of Your movement and tremble before Your gaze.'
Ibn Wahshiyya is  saying clearly that Zuhal is  the  master of the  other powers,
and that  they  are  subject  to  His  will.  He  goes  further,  stating  that  the  other
deities actually fear Zuhal. This raises some very serious questions about why
one deity would fear another. This point will be explored further below.

We may now consider The Picatrix, which has  a great deal to say about the
character and resonances of Zuhal.5 While it has more in general to say about
Zuhal than Nabataean Agriculture,  it was compiled later and uses the Agriculture
as one of its sources,  so it is necessary to consider it second. We then look not

of hot and cold spirits  and their occult points  as operated within the  Haitian Vodou tradi-
tion.

only for repetition within The Picatrix itself, but try to see if it echoes any themes
in Ibn Wahshiyya's works. On Zuhal, it reads  [Book 3.1]:

S a t u r n   for  example  is  the  planet  whose  source  holds  great  strength
and has the knowledge of mysterious orbit and the power to obtain the
reason behind things and the ability to find their intentions, the spell of
wonders  and knowledge  of secret  and mysterious  issues.  It  also  rules
the  Hebrew and Coptic  languages  and for  external body parts,  it  rules
the right ear, the outside parts and the spleen as an internal organ, which
also is considered the source of the black  [-] mixture of the body and the
joints and that which holds the whole parts together.

Its  fabrics:  all  kinds  of rough  fabrics,  its  professions:  leather  tanning,
farming and building and [mining]  and it rules the repulsive tastes like
the  wild  pear;  as  for  locations,  it  rules  black  mountains,  dark valleys,
basements, wells, graveyards and the wilderness.

Its jewels: onyx, black stones,  and loadstone.  Its  metals: lead,  iron,  and
everything  else  that  has  turned  black,  putrefied  and  stinky  smelling.
Its  plants:  oak,  safflower,  carob,  palm  tree,  caraway,  boxthorn,  cumin,
onion  and  all  hard-leaved  plants  and  thorny harmful  trees.  Its  drugs:
aloe,  myrrh,  their  equivalent,  wild  castor-oil  plant  and wild  colocynth.
Its scents: wisteria and licorice.

Its animals: every dark, black and ugly animal like black camels, sheep,
pigs, wolves, monkeys, dogs, cats and all birds with a long neck and gruff
voice like  ostriches,  buzzards,  owls, vermin,  crows,  bats,  cranes  and all
stinky,  dirty animals living underground.  Its colors: black, dark colors
and gray, and finally its symbol:

43

We will  employ the  same  technique  as  above,  and begin with  those  attri­
butes that The Picatrix repeats both within itself, or echoes from the Nabataean
Agriculture  (which it cites  at times). The text repeats the terms 'black' or 'dark'
several  times,  stressing  that  black  animals,  trees  and  minerals  are  sacred to
Zuhal. The use  of the term 'black stone' is  not accidental -  the Picatrix author
is  aware  that  the  Saturnine  idol  is  itself a  Black  Cube  of some  kind,  and  is
referencing the  Kaaba,  as  Ibn Wahshiyya has  done  prior.  The  text  also  refer-
ences  'knowledge'  and  'secret'  several  times.  This  indicates  that  Zuhal  rules
over  strange  and  unknown  things,  mysteries,  secrets,  and  matters  generally
considered hidden  or taboo.  He  is  not,  by contrast,  the  god  of public  knowl-
edge  (like  Mercury),  and one  does  not  approach  Saturn  to  apprehend things
which can be easily discovered by studies,  in books, or via normal channels of
information. Rather, Zuhal is a deity who guards secrets, grudges, things whis-
pered,  and mysteries that are buried by time  or other forces.  Zuhal is  not the
god of the researcher,  so much as the  god of the thief who steals the research
of another.  He  is  the  patron  of grave-robbers  and  archaeologists,  who  crack
open  the  tombs  and  secrets  of the  dead,  only to  hoard them  in  remote  loca-
tions. Whenever a movie shows knowledge concealed in a secret laboratory, or
ancient secrets sealed behind vault doors, that is a manifestation of Saturnine
power. The sigil noted above looks to be a partial rending of the better known
Saturnine sigil:

Later, The Picatrix elaborates on Zuhal's influence  [Book 3.7]:

Saturn's  power is cold, hard and its core is made of misfortune, corrup-
tion,  stinky,  vicious,  betrayal  and  is  scary.  Saturn  also  if he  gets  hold
of any matter  it betrays;  separates  and scares.  It has  the  pursuance  of

44

gardens,  rivers,  plowing,  farming,  provides with a lot of money,  cheap-
ness, poverty, disputes, traveling to far bad places, it also has the signs of
depression, grudge, cunning, circumcision, refuge, no socialization and
every other matter which has to do with evil,  forcefulness,  jail,  change,
fatigue,  hard work, weakness,  corruption,  truthful words,  friendliness,
determination  and  old  age,  advocacy,  building,  [depressions],  [fear],
too  much  thinking,  worries,  experiences,  anger,  insistent,  doing  less
goodness,  concerns,  sadness,  difficulties,  grimness,  death,  cheating,
inheritance,  accusations,  old  things,  brooding,  too  much  talking,  the
knowledge  of secrets,  the  mysterious  side  of things,  and  if Saturn  is
retrograde  it  holds  the  signs  of disgrace  and weakness.  It  also  has  the
signs of binding insistence  [restraint]  on certain matters, and if Saturn
as it is retrograde happens to face another planet, it weakens that planet
too.

These passages reveal a great deal about the way that the Ghayat/Picatrix tradi-
tion  understands  Zuhal.  The  Picatrix  here  stresses  terms  that  indicate  'fear,'
'betrayal,'  'age,'  and  'depression/sorrow,'  These  do  not  present  a  very  pleas-
ant  character  of the  deity,  in  fact,  Zuhal  seems  to  be  personified  as  a  grim,
curmudgeonly figure.  Significantly,  it notes that the deity has dominion over
secret knowledge, which has been discussed above. There is a definite unpleas-
antness  to  the way the  planet  is  described,  as  its  odor  is  repugnant,  reeking.
Most  significantly,  Saturn  is  dark  and  dreadful,  even  menacing.  If a  plant,
stone, animal, or place is rough, bitter, foul-smelling or foul-sounding, or dark
colored, it belongs to Saturn. These traits are considered distinctive attributes
of Saturn,  and  reflect  how  Muslim  magicians  understood  the  nature  of the
deity.

In  going  beyond  The  Picatrix,  we  note  that  its  compiler  repeats  the  earli-
er words  of Ibn Wahshiyya,  that  Saturn  is  cold.  At the  risk of re-stating what
that  transmission  has  already explained  so  clearly,  we  should  alert the  read-
er  once  more  to  the  important  fact that  Zuhal  is  understood  in  this  particu-
lar  Islamic  tradition  as  a  cold,  harsh,  distant  power.  Zuhal  is  the  icy,  harsh
power  that  embodies  restraint  -  which  can  come  from  sickness,  weakness,

45

age,  imprisonment,  isolation,  and  even  death.  He  is  the  deity  that  symbol-
izes  restraint,  and his  influence  corrupts  and distorts  the  power of the  other
planets,  to  the  point  that  the  Picatrix  tradition  warns  against  attempting
planetary  magic  if  Saturn  is  adversely  placed  or  retrograde,  as  the  tradi-
tion  holds  that  Saturn's  restraining  power  will  limit  or  distort  an  other-
wise  successful  magical  working.  This  is  echoed  strongly  towards  the  end
of The  Picatrix  in  Book  4 .4 ,  where  the  text  relates  the  'secret  natures'  of the
planetary  intelligences.  Of Saturn  it  says,  "The  secret  nature  of Zuhal  is  the
power of restraint,  sealing secrets,  destroying lands, troubling the heart,  and
becalming waters."  Clearly,  the  Saturnine  deity is  not only able to  overpower
human affairs, but to restrain the workings of other deities.

Like Nabataean Agriculture, The Picatrix contains several spells for contacting
the  Saturnine  deity.  These will be  discussed later  as  recommended practices
in Section Three, but it would be wise to explore one here. The Picatrix reads in
Book III:

When you address Saturn, dress yourself in black. Betake yourself to the
proper  place  on  Saturday,  having  in  hand  an  iron  ring,  and take  with
you a censor in which you place charcoal burning with incense.  [Recipe
of incense omitted for brevity]. Having censed the place, speak thus:

'Oh great master who possesses a great name and who is situated above
all planets, you  [who are  placed]  high and in  an  elevated place. You are
the  Lord  Saturn,  cold  and  dry,  shadowy,  author  of good,  true  in  your
friendship,  sincere  in your  promises,  persistent  and tenacious  in your
friendships  and  enmities,  of tenacious  and  profound  intellect,  true  in
your  sayings  and  your  promises,  unique  in  your  operations,  isolate,
apart  from  the  other  gods,  with  sorrow  and  suffering,  distant  from
mindless  pleasure.  You  are  the  old one,  the  ancient,  at  once  wise  and
a destroyer of good judgement, you mix good and evil.  Sad and unhap-
py is he who vexes you,  happy is he whom you favor.  In you are  placed
virtue and power,  a spirit of doing good and evil.  I demand,  father and
lord, by your high names and your marvelous actions to do for me such

46

and such... I call you by your names, oh Heylil, you in the seventh heaven:
Zuhal (Arabic),  Saturn  (Latin),  Keyvan  (Persian),  Chronos  (Greek),  Sani
(India).'

This text echoes the element o f 'cold' and adds to it 'dry.' It includes the dichot-
omy that Zuhal is far away, above all other planetary spheres, and it is good to
note once more that 'Zuhal' in Arabic actually means 'the distant,' or 'the alien.'
One notes also the dichotomy between good and evil, since the invoker clearly
hopes to gain one and avoid the other. This particular spell is also quite inter-
esting,  because  the  invoker  demonstrates  the  Hermetic  thinking  that what-
ever entity he or she calls 'Zuhal' in Arabic is the  same entity that a European
calls 'Saturn' or 'Chronos,' or a Persian calls 'Keyvan,' or an Indian calls 'Sani.' It
is significant that Saturday in Arabic is understood to be Saturn's day, despite
the fact that in Arabic it is simply called yom al-sebt, meaning 'the seventh day.'
The  text  describes,  finally,  the  people  who  are  most vulnerable  to  Zuhal's

influence:

Saturn  is  used to  ask for needs that you desire from chieftains,  nobles,
presidents, kings, old people and dead people, criminals, recipients, the
people  benefiting  of inheritance,  heroes,  deputies,  peasants,  builders,
slaves, thieves,  parents,  grandparents and prominent people and if you
are  sad or sick with a deadly disease  and every other similar request of
the same nature ask for it from Saturn with the help o f a drawing that I
make for you.  [Book 4.7]

This is a very broad list of people and professions. On the one hand, this can be
understood to be  a list of people who have  a natural Saturnine  resonance;  on
the other hand,  it can indicate that certain classes or types of people are espe-
cially vulnerable  to  Saturn's  influence.  Some  of these,  like  kings  and  rulers,
are  shared by Jupiter,  and others,  like  heroes,  by Mars.  Saturn,  however,  has
several that are unique to himself, like criminals and the dead. It is noteworthy
that  Islamic  tradition  and the  pre-Islamic Arab  and  Persian  traditions  lack  a
coherent doctrine  of necromancy,  because they did not really have  a belief in

47

the effective  dead. They were  certainly ahead of their time  in  having celestial
magic, and elaborate hierarchies of spirits and angels, but there are no records
that relate to people working magic through ghosts, because these cultures had
relatively few accounts of ghosts or phantoms. They were not taboo so much as
they were  ignored or discounted.  Ghouls  and spirits,  however,  were  counted
as being very real, and as Nabataean Agriculture and The Picatrix show, the magi-
cians of these cultures believed very much in the visible summoning of spirits,
even in front of an audience.

Nevertheless, Zuhal is said to have influence over death and the dead. Since
necromancy is not an attested Islamic practice in text or contemporary folklore,
we may understand that The dead' refers to affairs that are related to the dead,
such  as  inheritance,  or  knowledge  that  disappears  with  the  dead,  or  similar
such things.6 One notes also the curious passage quoted above on p.40, where
the  invoker prays,  “Then when we  die, ward off the worms  and reptiles  from
our flesh." Saturn appears to be connected to the state of the corpse, which has
been interred at this point. As Islamic tradition holds that the spirit remains in
the grave until Judgement Day, perhaps the idea here is that Saturn can main-
tain the corpse (the abode of the spirit) in a better state than it might otherwise
achieve.  Nevertheless,  Saturn  has  a very chthonic  aspect  and is  connected to
the soil,  especially that which  is  subterranean.  He has  an  agricultural nature,
but  this  is  related  primarily  to  those  things  which  grow  underground  (like
turnips),  not above ground (like corn).  He is also the lord of deep, dark places
like  caves,  caverns,  graves,  and things  which  have  been  buried,  or  blackened
with time, and also those animals which live deep underground. This is a very
interesting feature for a planetary deity which was thought to be Tar away" on
the very edge of space/time.  Perhaps this is because in the medieval mind, the
deep underground is  also  a kind of Tar away,' and closer to the  subterranean
kingdom which Zuhal was thought to inhabit.

It is worth noting that in the Iranian tradition, which is part of The Picatrix,
the distant (Persian 'Keyvan') is said to be extremely cold, and yet to be directly

6  Nevertheless, Saturn’s connection to the dead will be discussed further below.

48

connected to the underworld.7 This seems paradoxical, unless one accepts that
the  ancient  Islamic  conception  of the  Saturnine  deity had the  dual  aspect  of
being  alien  and  removed,  yet  also  deeply subterranean.  This  is  likely coming
from the  idea that the orbit  (eqlim)  of Saturn was understood to be  spherical,
and  so  Saturn  must  be  as  far  below us  as  He  is  above,  and  so  those  deepest
places in the earth become sacred to Him by virtue of their being 'distant' from
us.

Saturnine  Appearances:  Theophanies
In considering the Islamic understanding of the Saturnine deity, it would also
be  good to consider the way that the entity is  said to manifest visibly when  it
is  called.  It  is  understood  that  the  deity's  manifestation  is  a  literal  phenom-
enon,  but  also  that  its  panoply  is  symbolic  of the  Saturnine  deity's  qualities.
While Nabataean Agriculture is generally silent on the appearance of Saturn, The
Picatrix and Kitab al-Ustuwwatas both provided some visual description  of the
Saturnine theophany (divine appearance) and also the idols of Zuhal.

The  Kitab  al-Ustuwwatas  is  a  curious  Islamic  text,  which  transmits  a
Saturnine anecdote from India.8 The text relates that at a time when India was
still uncivilized and people were essentially 'savages,' there ruled a king called
Safnadula.  He had a dream in which Saturn appeared to him as a 'black man,'
and instructed him to convene  all his  governors together for a religious cere-
mony before the black stone idol of Saturn.  Safnadula did so,  and all 72 of his
nobles came for the religious event. The nobles and the statue were incensed,
and  an  animal was  sacrificed before  the  idol.  The  'black  man'  emerged  from
the idol, and bestowed one of his 72 spirits to each of the nobles, along with the
secret name of that spirit, so that the noble would be able to invoke or evoke the

spirit when he returned to his home province.9 The manuscript,  interestingly,
provides  the  names  of the  72  spirits,  in  case  some  aspiring  magician  wishes
to  try  such  a  ceremony at home.10 11 These  spirits  are  said to  have  entered into
the nobles, and empowered them to be effective at 'civilizing' the various king-
doms which make up India. It is worth noting here that one major distinction
of medieval  Islamic  magic  is  that there  is  to be  a recurring theme  of a magi-
cian  being  able  to  evoke  a  spirit visibly before  a  crowd,  with  the  expectation
that the  entity will  appear  in visible  form.11 This  tradition  is  also  interesting,
because it connects Saturn with the earliest levels of government, and depicts
an ancient time in which Saturn is the only deity,  and the patron of the  state.
This  is echoed by the  Roman tradition,  in which  Saturn  is the  founding deity
of the Italian kingdom.

In terms of the theophanies,  the Picatrix compiler cites two sources:  one  is
The Interpretation of Spiritual Talismans and the other is The Benefits of the Rocks of
Mercury. The first of these describes Zuhal as appearing as a crow-headed and
camel-footed  man,  seated  on  a  throne,  with  a  scepter  in  the  right  hand  and
a spear in the left hand. The crow and camel are both  noted in  The Picatrix as
being Saturnine animals. The crow is  a black bird with an ugly voice,  and the
camel is a tough, enduring animal with an ugly voice,  and inhabits the desert
(Zuhal's  territory).  The  crow represents  wisdom  and malice,  while  the  camel
represents  endurance.  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  being  camel-footed  was  a
demonic attribute in the Arab folklore of North Africa and Andalusia.  Even in
contemporary popular culture,  the  demoness  'Ai'sha  Kandisha  is  said to  be  a
beautiful woman with  camel's  feet.  This  is  analogous  to  Christian  folklore  in
which the  Devil can  be  recognized by his  cloven-hooves.  Zuhal  is  seated on  a
throne (or chair) because He is a sovereign, and He bears a scepter as a symbol of
dominion, and the spear is indicative of His ability to afflict harm or hardship.

9  The occurrence of the number “72” may be significant. It calls to mind the Egyptian tradition,

in which the god o f darkness (Seth) also has 72 companions.
10  The list o f names in Latin and Arabic appear in Appendix I.
11

If one  assumes  that  magic  is  not  a  real  force,  this  seems  a very  strange  thing  to  suggest

to  someone who has  the  financial wherewithal to  actually acquire these  texts  (which were

extremely costly).

50

An  alternate yet  related description  is  the  same,  but has  Zuhal standing on  a
pulpit, which symbolizes that He is said to be a master of wisdom, secrets, and
the religious sciences.

The second theophany, described in Benefits of  the Rocks of Mercury, describes
the Saturnine deity as a man who holds a whale over his head, and is standing
atop a dragon. This  is a very interesting description,  as dragons  are curiously
quite  rare in Arabic  sources,  though more common in  Persian or Indian. The
dragon symbolizes dark, chaotic forces which are under Saturn's control. He is
not spearing or killing the animal (like St George or Archangel Michael), rather
it is the foundation of his power.  Saturn in turn supports the whale, which in
Islamic cosmology supports the cosmos itself. This  image makes Zuhal into a
sub-chthonic figure.
the
Alternately,

same

text
describes Saturn as He stands atop
a  dragon,  and  bears  a  sickle  and
a  scepter,  alternately  just  a  large
scythe,  and  is  robed  in  grey  and
black (see image on the right, from
Krakow,  Biblioteka  Jagiellonska,
MS  793,  from  Pingree's  edition).
One  notes  that  the  scepter  indi-
cates  dominion,  and  the  scythe
is  the  instrument  of reaping.  As
one  might expect,  Saturn  himself
is  clothed  in  dark  colors,  namely
blacks and greys.

As  noted  above,  the  Kitab  al-
Ustuwwatas  describes  a  Saturnine
theophany  from  India,  in  which
the  deity  manifests  in  the  dream
of King  Safnadula,  and then  later
manifests  in  public  view  after  a
ritual is  publicly performed.  Here

51

the deity appears as a dark-skinned man, dressed in robes of black, green, and
yellow.  The  black  is  chthonic,  while  green  is  a  reference  to  the  agricultural
aspect of Saturn,  and the color yellow is likely a reference to the  Hindu belief
that Saturn  (Sani)  is the son of the solar deity Surya. Thus in all three theoph-
anies, one notes the repetition of the Saturnine deity appearing as a male figure
in dark colors (grey or black).

Saturnine  Appearances:  Idols
The  Picatrix,  Nabataean  Agriculture,  and  Kitab  al-Ustuwwatas  all  mention  the
worship of the Saturnine deity involving an idol, to which sacrifices are made.
Ibn  Wahshiyya  in  Nabataean Agriculture  states  that  the  idol  is  a  black  stone,
which  should be  placed on black sand. The Kitab al-Ustuwwatas mentions that
the  Saturnine  deity  emerges  from  his  idol  after  an  animal  is  sacrificed,  but
does not describe the idol itself. This is paralleled by an account in The Picatrix
(3.9)  where  the  anonymous  compiler  describes  a  ceremony  from  the  Kitab
al-Istimatis,  in which  one  makes  an  idol with  iron  feet,  iron  of course being a
metal of Saturn.  The  idol is  to  be  dressed in  clothes  of black,  green,  and red.
This directly parallels the supposed Indian account of Saturn,  except that red
(also a solar color) replaces yellow.

However,  The  Picatrix compiler  also  uses  a  second  account  from  the  Kitab
al-Istimatis  tradition,  in  which  he  describes  the  Saturnine  deity  as  a  cube.
Specifically, he notes that Saturn's 'soul' is an entity called 'Brimas,' which has
six  component  souls,  which  are  top,  bottom,  left,  right,  front  and  back.  An
additional spirit holds them together, like a binding agent. He states that their
names  are  (Picatrix 3.9):  Brimas  (The  Composite  Soul),  then  Tus  (Top),  Khrus
(Bottom),  Ciyus (Right), Diriyus (Left), Tamus (Front), Dorus (Back), and Tihitus
(Binder). While the color of the cube is not mentioned,  given that the text has
explicitly stated above that Saturn's color is black, it is almost certainly a Black
Cube.

As noted previously, the description of the Saturnine deity as a 'black stone'
or  as  a  six-sided  idol  could  only  have  been  interpreted  as  a  direct  reference
to the black stone  (al-hajar al-aswad),  of Mecca, which is the  symbolic heart of
the Kaaba.  For those unfamiliar with the legend, it is said that the black stone

52

fell from the heavens in the time of Adam and Eve, and has served as a sacred
marker since the dawn of humanity. While some believe it to be basalt or glass,
it is most likely predominantly iron ore if it is indeed the remnants of a mete-
orite. The legend of black iron falling from the sky, and becoming worshipped
by ancient pagan tribes suggests that it was originally an idol with no connec-
tion to the Abrahamic deity. This  point will be discussed further below in the
Second  Section  (Saturnine  Gnosis).  Yet  for  the  moment,  suffice  to  say  that
the  Islamic  tradition  either  suggests  a  humanoid  idol  dressed  in  black  with
secondary colors, or else a black stone cube.

53

Saturn in the Classical T radition

In the study of classical tradition and magic, the Saturnine deity occupies a

very complex position. This may be partially because the various myths and
traditions that include Saturn are themselves quite varied, even extremely so,
yet quite clearly address a singular deity and not a composite deity like Jupiter/
Zeus.  It  should  also  be  noted  that when  we  speak  about  'classical'  tradition,
we  normally  refer  to  the  hybrid  Hellenistic  culture  that  was  partially  Greek
and partially Latin,  and usually referred to as 'Roman'  When we  speak about
anything 'Roman'  we need to be aware that there genuinely was such a thing
as  Italic  (or  Latin)  culture  prior  to  Greek  influences,  but  even  that  seems  to
have  had  Etruscan  influences.  Greek  and  Italic  language  and  culture  were
separate,  but  did  share  some  parallels  due  to  their  common  Indo-European
heritage. Greek religion and myth might have had parallels to its Italian coun-
terparts, and when Greek learning and culture entered into Roman culture, it
had a profound effect on the Roman myths, if not rituals. That said, this chap-
ter will examine the deity known as 'Cronos' or 'Chronos' in Greek, and 'Saturn'
in Latin.12

12  For  the  sake  o f ease  in  this  chapter,  we  will  use  the  proper  name  'Saturn'  as  opposed  to

‘Saturn/Cronos'  unless otherwise noted.

55

There is some dispute over the etymology of the name 'Saturn'  but the best
explanation to-date is that it is a Latin adaptation of the Etruscan underworld
god Satre. Satre was a malevolent chthonic figure, identified with the northern
direction,  also with  storms  and  earthquakes.  There  are  rival  explanations  of
the  name,  but none  are  as tenable.  'Cronos'  on the  other hand,  clearly stems
from Greek keir (to cut),  and is connected with kar (action)  in  Sanskrit, which
yields  karma.  Saturn/Cronos  is  also  connected  with  the  agricultural  func-
tion  of cutting,  in the  sense of the  harvest,  and so the  sickle  has  always  been
the  principal  symbol  of the  Saturnine  deity. As  agriculture  has  various  stag­
es  (sowing,  growing,  harvest),  Saturn  was  the  deity  responsible  for  the  final
stage  of agriculture,  hence  the  scythe/sickle  as  a  symbol.  Of course,  Saturn's
nature  of harvesting was  understood to  be  more  broad than  just  agriculture
-  Saturn was the harvester of all things, even the gods, as his mythology makes
plain.  Saturn  is  not a creator deity;  his  role  is  more  related to entropy within
the  cosmic  framework.  Saturn/Cronos  is  identified also with Time. This  may
be  possibly  due  to  Cronos'  name  being  similar  to  'chronos'  (time)  in  Greek.
Time is itself a reaper, a force that ends the lives of all living beings and human
enterprises. The mythology of the Greeks and Romans shows that the empires
of the gods are vulnerable to time and change, and this negative aspect of time
is embodied by the Saturnine deity.

Saturn, according to Greek and Roman culture, was partnered with a female
consort,  usually said to be his  sister.  Interestingly, the earlier accounts  of the
deity suggest that this was Lua Mater, which translates as 'Mother Destruction.'
It is well known that in  Indo-European  religious  systems,  death and destruc-
tion  are  often  embodied  by  female  figures  such  as  the  Irish  Morrigan  and
Indian  Kali  Ma.  Roman  records  report that the worship  of this  goddess,  Lua
Mater, involved the offering of enemy weapons, taken as the spoils of victory,
which were  immolated.  It is  likely that this  sacrifice was  part of a dual offer-
ing,  in  which  the  enemy  combatants  were  burned  (alive  or  dead)  to  Saturn,
while their arms and armor were burned simultaneously to  Lua.  Such a ritual
finds  parallels  in  the purushamedha  rites  of the Vedas,  which,  like  the  Roman
human sacrifices, fell into disuse with time. While this may seem brutal, even
shocking to the  contemporary reader,  it should be kept in  mind that the  reli-

56

gious  and  sacrificial  practices  of the  ancient  world were  often  quite  bloody,
as  exemplified  best  by  the  Celts  of Europe,  and  the  Aztecs  in  the  Americas.
The  fact that  Saturn's  female  counterpart was  actually named 'destruction' is
strongly suggestive of Saturn's own dangerous nature. In later time, however,
as  Saturn's  nature  was  rehabilitated by the  Roman  state,  his  spouse  became
identified as Ops, the Roman goddess of plenty and wealth.  Her cult was cele-
brated in the  Republic,  like  Saturn's,  as  a more benign  agricultural tradition.
The Greeks,  on the other hand,  always identified Cronos with his  sister Rhea,
the daughter of Gaia, who was (like Ops) associated with the benign aspects of
the agriculture and the harvest.

There  are  several  conflicting  myths  that  concern  Saturn's  parentage,  but
the discrepancies are minor. The popular Greek account is that the parents of
Cronos were the titans Uranus  and Gaia,  and the alternate version is that He
was the son of the titan-serpents Ophion and Eurynome. Tradition claims that
Cronos overthrew his own father,  in  some versions with the help of his  sister
Rhea  (Latin  Ops),  and  then  seized  control  over  the  cosmos.  In  the  account
featuring  Uranus,  Cronos  uses  a  sickle  or  scythe  to  sever  his  father's  geni-
tals, which are cast into the ocean,  and so the sickle/scythe becomes the chief
emblem of Cronos/Saturn thereafter.

The  Roman  account  is  somewhat  different,  though  it  shows  Greek  influ-
ences.  Macrobius  takes  the  traditional  Hellenic  account,  and  helps  inter-
pret  it  using  Latinate  terminology  for  his  Roman  audience.  He  states  in  the
Saturnalia  (1.8.)  that  initially  there  was  Primal  Chaos,  and  there  was  not yet
any such concept or being as Time, because Chaos was itself eternal (cum chaos
esset,  tempora  non fuisse).  When  the  primordial  being  Coelus  (cosmos)  came
into being, its appearance ruptured the purity of Chaos, and severed existence
from non-existence. This act o f 'cutting' Chaos away from the newborn cosmos
created Time  (Saturn), which Macrobius infers is the remnant of Chaos with-
in  existence.  This  is  evident  in  that Time  brings  change  and instability to  all
things  in  time,  even  to  gods  and  kingdoms.  Time  is  chaotic,  and  therefore
hostile  to  the  cosmos,  and Greek  and  Roman  tradition  agree  that  as  soon  as
Saturn/Cronos  came  into  being,  He  attacked his  own  cosmic  'father,'  depos-
ing him and taking control of the cosmos.  Macrobius also points  out that the

57

Saturnalia and Cronia festivals are absolutely wild,  chaotic revels  in which all
social  norms  and  taboos  were  violated,  and  the  social  order  was  completely
inverted. This celebration of Chaos, which was otherwise entirely antithetical
to the Roman state, is a recognition of Saturn as a being that ultimately stems
from Chaos, despite his 'creation' coming from the act of Coelus (cosmos).

The Greek and Roman myths agree that the rule of the Saturnine deity was
a  golden  age  of plenty  and  enlightenment,  and  all  beings  thrived  under  the
care  of the  monarch.  However,  Saturn  himself was  deposed by his  own  chil-
dren. When it was reported to him that his children would pose a threat to his
existence,  Saturn  consumed the  infant deities whole.  Sculptors  and painters
have  presented  this  scene  grotesquely,  usually with  an  old  man  chewing  on
the  flesh  of a screaming infant. While this  image  is  colorful and provocative,
the  traditions  indicate  that  Saturn  swallowed his  children  whole,  much  as  a
person might swallow a medical pill. The children are contained,  undamaged
but dormant, within the being of the  Saturnine deity until his youngest child
(Zeus/Jupiter)  releases them by use of a purgative, and then the younger gods
war against Saturn and the Titans.  Saturn was deposed by Jupiter, but Jupiter
was  unable to destroy Saturn,  just as  Saturn  could not  destroy Coelus.  Gods,
it must be  noted,  are  resilient beings,  yet  in  mythology they can  be  maimed,
crippled,  and  imprisoned.  Saturn,  then,  is  placed  in  chains,  and banished to
the chthonic realm of Tartarus, which He is said to rule.13 The 'chains' of Saturn
become one of the definitive parts of his divine panoply thereafter.

While  Cronos  is  relegated  to  being  a  sort  of god-devouring  monster  in
Hellenic tradition, the Roman Saturn is a much more beloved figure. Although
Jupiter,  Mars,  and Minerva become the major gods of the empire,  the  Roman
state  and  its  historians  acknowledged  that  Saturn  was  the  original  deity  of
the  Roman  people,  and  in  fact  they  claimed  that  Italians  themselves  were
descended from Saturn. The Mons Saturnius is one of the hills on which Rome
was  built,  and  the  oldest  temple  in  Rome  belongs  to  Saturn.  Saturn  has  his

13  According to an alternate tradition,  Saturn is banished to Italy, where he fathers the Italic
people.  This  corresponds  to  Caesar's  remarks  that  the  Gauls  o f France  considered  them-
selves descended from Dis Pater.

58

own  priesthood,  and  the  state  treasury was  kept  at  his  temple.  The  original
name  of the  Italian  settlement situated on  the  site of Rome was  'Saturnium.'
Further,  Saturn  enjoyed  a week-long  series  of revels  each year,  which  began
on 17 December.  For a deposed deity, Saturn enjoyed a very profound respect,
second perhaps only to Jupiter. The very memory of Saturn's prior rule was not
one of a cruel despot, but as noted above,  a golden age where all living beings
lacked for nothing.

Yet Saturn's character is not benign,  and there are no records that suggest
otherwise.  Being  the  king  of  an  age  of  plenty  does  not  suggest  that  the
Saturnine deity was a kindly master, but rather that under His reign, the earth
did not withhold its bounty. Saturn was the origin of the western image of the
Grim  Reaper,  and as the deity identified with harvesting,  He was expected to
harvest plants,  animals,  and humans alike. Macrobius reports  (1.7)  that in the
earliest  memories  of the  Italic  peoples,  Saturn  was  worshipped with  human
sacrifices;  later,  when  this  practice  fell  into  disfavor,  torches were  burned  in
His  honor  as  a  substitute.  Modern  scholars,  however,  of the  classical  period
argue that Macrobius is only partially correct: there is no question that human
sacrifice was part of the worship of the Reaper. However, while Macrobius tries
to suggest that burning torches substituted for human sacrifices, Versnel has
discussed the  considerable evidence that the  gladiatorial games were  carried
out as ritual observances  (munera) to Saturn.14 The practice of human sacrifice
was not solely an Italic custom. The Greeks too performed human sacrifices to
Cronos on the day of his festival, the Cronia. Pophyry reports that in the city of
Rhodes, on the day of the Cronia, a criminal was taken to the gates of the city,
given alcohol, and then slaughtered.15

The  Greeks  and  Romans  had  conflicting,  even  paradoxical  views  of the
world under Saturn's  rule.  Both cultures agreed that at some distant point in
time, the Saturnine deity had been master of the three worlds, celestial, terres-
trial,  and chthonic  (alternately,  earth,  ocean,  and underworld). While  Saturn
ruled, the world was a utopia, a golden age of plenty. All were equal, and thrived

somehow under Saturn's rule. The celebrated Roman poet Virgil mentions this
in his fourth Eclogue, lines 5-8:

Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;
Magnus ah integro saeclorum nascitur ordo.
iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Satumia regna,
iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.

Now comes the final era of the Sibyl's song;
The great order of the ages is born afresh.
And now justice returns, the return of Saturn's reign;
Now a new lineage is sent down from high heaven.

Clearly, Virgil is not suggesting the return of the Saturnine kingdom as a hideous
nightmare.  Nevertheless,  the  Saturnine  kingdom  was  not  ideal,  for  which
reason it had to be overthrown by the Olympian gods. Saturn was an aspect of
Chaos, and so the equality enjoyed by all was an equality of utter subjugation.
In  fact,  the  gods  themselves  had absolutely no  part  in  the  Saturnine  empire,
since Saturn committed cannibalism, consuming the deities and holding them
within  his  own  essence.  The  Titans  may have  enjoyed  His  rule,  but  arguably
they also were monstrous aberrations that had survived from the same primor-
dial Chaos  as their king.  It should not be  forgotten that the  hundred-handed
monsters known in Greek as the Hecatonchires or Latin as Centimanes were actu-
ally the brothers of Saturn, and differed from Him largely in that their chaotic
essence was evident physically, where Saturn's was internal. The eventual war
of the gods and the titans was the battle of Chaos against order, as with similar
battles across many mythologies.

The Roman festival of the Saturnalia (Greek Cronia) deserves some consid-
eration.  Macrobius  (1.7)  reports  that  initially,  the  entire  tenth  month  of the
year,  December, was sacred to Saturn, while the eleventh, January, was sacred
to Janus. Within the tenth month,  the  ancient  Italians,  and the  Romans who
followed  them,  celebrated  the  festival  of Saturn  for  seven  days,  from  17-23
December.  The  Saturnalia was wild,  even  debauched,  and orgiastic  at times.

60

During this  period,  all  norms  and taboos were  overturned.  Servants  became
masters,  and  masters  became  servants.  Servants  could  (and  did)  abuse  and
insult their owners, and may even have taken sexual liberties with them, much
as their masters would have used their slaves at a whim throughout the year.
Celebrants greeted each other with the cry ‘io Saturnalia'  which served to remind
each other that they were celebrating a religious occasion. A Saturnine Prince,
the Princeps Satumalicus, was appointed in place of the usual king or emperor,
to serve as the master of ceremonies, and his dictates were generally followed.
Small, humorous gifts were given by friends, and it was a time for pranks, fool-
ishness,  and otherwise normally unacceptable behavior.  Exceptionally during
the  Saturnalia  festival,  the  chains  or  cords  which  normally  tied  the  legs  of
Saturn's idol were undone, symbolizing His temporary release from bondage.
In our contemporary spiritual cynicism, one might think 'Yes, well no doubt
things  didn't get too carried away -  what slave would abuse his owner,  know-
ing social norms would go back to normal on  December 24th?' Or equally, one
might reasonably ask why such a bizarre festival was celebrated at all, when it
must have caused some awkwardness when it was over,  much alike any good
party does when the majority of the guests are intoxicated and wild. The reply
to  both  objections  is  that  the  ancients  truly  did  believe  that  the  gods  were
real  beings,  and  not  simply the vapid  archetypes  that  modern  occultism  has
reduced  them  to.  The  Romans  and  Greeks  believed that  Saturn/Cronos  was
an actual deity, malevolent in character, and that this festival was intended to
appease Him, so that He would not curse them with long-term or even perma-
nent  social  chaos.  If the  celebrations  were  carried out  half-heartedly,  people
believed  that  Saturn  would  be  angered,  and  thus  debauchery  and  madness
needed to  be  embraced  and  reveled  in.  To  the  author's  knowledge,  there  are
no records of Roman nobles objecting publicly to the festivals;  at worst,  some
admitted that they tried to escape from it by traveling at that time. It was only
later in the Christian period that the  Saturnalia festival was downplayed, and
somewhat suspiciously,  December 25th became a prominent Christian holiday
which involves the exchange of presents.

Further, and this will be already obvious to the reader, the Romans consid-
ered  the  seventh  day  of the  Roman  week  as  'Saturn's  Day,'  which  survives

61

even into modern English as 'Saturday'  It is curious that given the number of
Roman deities that are attested, one of the seven days was  given to this deity.
This  suggests again that despite the popularity of the later gods, the figure of
Saturn  remained of major importance to the  Roman  citizenry,  as  days  of the
week were named only after major divinities.

Saturn  A s  A   Mag ical  Deity
Saturn/Cronos  appears  in  classical  and  medieval  Hermetic  magic  as  a  force
of restraint, divination, or malefica. Plutarch tells us of a magical island in the
West which is  supposed to be the  prison of Cronos.  Confined to a grotto and
sleeping on a golden stone, Cronos rules the island and is being served by his
former subjects  in the  shape  of daemons.  Locked in  a magical sleep in which
he  receives  secret wisdom,  he  communicates  with  humans  who  come  to  the
island in regular intervals through the intermediation of the daemons. These
appear to the human  islanders  in  dreams  or even  in  liminal waking states  to
reveal His gnosis. This secret island and its mysteries are only accessible to the
magical dreamer who is able to relate to the dream-consciousness of this para-
disiacal world and its ruler, Cronos.

In  the  Papyri  Graecae  Magicae  (pgm)  we  find  repeated  references  to  the
'chains of Cronos' as a force invoked for binding, or as something by which the
gods  themselves  swear. There  is  one  particular  spell called the  'Salt Oracle  of
Cronos,' which is essentially a divination spell.

The pgm  reports:

'Oracle of Cronos' in great demand, called 'little mill': Take two measures
of salt and grind with a handmill while  saying the formula many times
until the god appears to you. Do it at night in a place where grass grows.
If while you  are  speaking you  hear  the  heavy  step  of [someone]  and  a
clatter  of iron,  the  god is  coming  bound with  chains,  holding  a  sickle.
But do not be frightened since you are protected by the phylactery that
will be revealed to you. Be clothed with clean linen in the garb o f a priest
of Isis.  Offer  to  the  god  sage  together with  a  heart  of a  cat  and  horse
manure.

62

The formula to be spoken while you are mixing is this:

I   call  you,  the  great,  holy,  the  one  who  created  the  whole  inhabited
world,  against  whom  the  transgression  was  committed  by  your  own
son,  whom  Helios  bound with  adamantine  fetters  lest the  universe  be
mixed together, you hermaphrodite, father of the thunderbolt, you who
hold down those under the earth, Aie Oi Paidalis Phrenoteicheido Stygardes
Sankleon / Genechrona  Koirapsai Kerideu  Thala-Mnia  Ochota Anedei;  come,
master, god, and tell me by necessity concerning the nn matter, for I am
the one who revolted against you, Paidolis Mainolis Mainolieus.’ These are
to be said while the salt is being ground.

And  the  formula which  compels  him  is:
‘Kybdohris  Koderieus Ankyrieus
Xantomoulis.’ You  say  these  things  when  He  appears  threateningly,  in
order that He might be subdued and speak about the things you ask.

The  phylactery in  great demand for him  [is]:  On the  rib of a young pig
carve Zeus holding fast a sickle and this name: ‘Chthoumilon.’ Or let it be
the rib of a black, scaly, castrated boar.

Dismissal:  Anaea  Ocheta  Thalamnia  Keri-Deu  /  Koirapsia  Genechrona
Sanelon Sty-Gardes Chleido Phrainole Paidolis laei,  Go away,  master of the
world,  forefather;  go  to your  own  places  in  order  that  the  universe  be
maintained. Be gracious to us, lord.'  [pgm  iv. 3086-3124; italics mine]

The  text  makes  a  point  of saying  that  the  spell  is  'in  great  demand,'  which
suggests that it was known to be effective. Nevertheless, half of the spell is the
instructions for protecting oneself from the Titan's anger,  as the instructions
make  clear  that  if Cronos  appears,  He  will  be  angry.  He  must  be  compelled
to cooperate,  and the magician must take precautions  against Him. The  spell
identifies Cronos  as having knowledge of the  future, which is  an  indicator of
His  control over time.  The  spell  is  said to  actually compel the  god to  appear,
and when  He  does,  His  panoply includes  chains  and  a  sickle.  The  god is  not

63

expected to stay,  and in fact the magician must insist that Cronos "go to  [his]
own  places  in  order  that  the  universe  be  maintained/'  in  other  words,  that
Cronos must return to His star, and to the chthonic depths of Tartarus.  If the
Saturnine  deity were  to  remain,  His  presence would destabilize  the  cosmos,
because Saturn is himself a being of Chaos.

Speaking of Chaos, the pgm also mentions Cronos more directly in connec-
tion with Chaos, and as the scepter-bestower of the goddess Hecate. In pgm  iv.
2841-2847, the scroll reads:

As everlasting band around your temples
You wear great Cronos' chains, unbreakable
And unremovable, and you hold in
Your hands a golden scepter. Letters around
Your scepter Cronos wrote himself and gave
To you to wear that all things stay steadfast:
Subduer and subdued, mankind's subduer,
And force-subduer; Chaos, too, you rule.

The text here states that Hecate, herself a Titan that survived the revolt of the
gods, wears the chains of Cronos.  It cannot be thought that these chains are a
punishment -  rather, they are symbols of the restraining and binding power of
the Saturnine deity. Likewise, the text states that Cronos has inscribed a magi-
cal  formula  on  the  scepter  (like,  torches)  which  Hecate  bears.  Immediately
after,  the  text  states  that  Hecate  rules  Chaos -   as  the  scepter  is  the  emblem
of rule,  and  it  has  just  been  mentioned,  the  text  is  eluding  that  Cronos  has
transmitted or delegated part of his power over Chaos to Hecate. This stands to
reason, as like Saturn, Hecate is a remnant of the golden age, who has uniquely
survived the transition into the Hellenic age of the gods.

Saturn is not only a magical deity in the classical period, but is also invoked
in  the  medieval  period which  follows.  Kieckhefer's  work  on  medieval  necro-
mancy,  entitled Forbidden  Rites,  reports  that a 15th  century  European  text,  the
Liber Angelis,  contains  a  Saturnine  experiment  to  destroy an  enemy.  It  reads
(pp. 71-72):

64

Later medieval books of magic are seldom shy about giving straightfor-
wardly  harmful  formulas.  A  fifteenth-century  Liber  de  angelis,  annulis,
karecteribus et imaginibus plantetarum  (Book of angels,  rings,  characters,
and images of the planets) in the Cambridge University Library contains
an experiment called the Vindicta Troie (Vengeance of Troy), which can be
used to arouse hatred or to cause bodily harm or even death. The proce-
dure calls for making an image on the day and in the hour of Saturn, in
the name of the person to be harmed. The image must be made of wax,
preferably from candles used at a funeral. It should be as ugly as possible;
the face should be contorted, and there should be hands in place of feet
and vice versa.  The victim's  name  should be  inscribed on  the  forehead
of the image,  the name of the planet Saturn on its breast, and the  seals
or characters  of Saturn between its  shoulders. The operator should call
upon the spirits of Saturn to descend from on high and afflict the named
victim. The image should be fumigated with various substances, includ-
ing human bones and hair, then wrapped in a funeral cloth and buried in
some unclean place, face downward. If the magician wishes to harm any
particular member of the victim's body, there are instructions for bind-
ing the  corresponding  member  on  the  image with  a  funeral  cloth  and
piercing the image with a needle; to kill the victim, the magician should
insert the needle into the spine, from the head down to the heart.

It is  significant that this 'operation' or 'experiment' is called the Vindicta Troie
(Vengeance  of Troy),  which  suggests  that  the  necromancer  performing  it
would have  understood the  rite  to be  classical  (Greco-Roman)  in  terms  of its
origin period.

Saturnine  Appearances
Western culture has many images of Saturn that have survived from antiquity.
These  include  statues,  carvings,  and later,  paintings.  Traditionally,  Saturn  is
depicted as an older man, crooked but muscular. Usually He is heavily bearded.
He wears a black chiton, or robe, and in the Latin style His head is shrouded by
His toga (see image on p. 66). The shrouding of His head is a rare thing among

65

divinities,  and  is  thought  to  symbolize  His  alien  nature,  or  'otherness,'  and
likely also His chthonic nature. In the Republic and Empire, the legs of Saturn's
idol were bound with woolen cords, symbolizing the chains of His panoply. He
bears a scythe,  or alternately a sickle  (see  images below).  In many of the later
carvings  of Saturn,  especially  those  which  emphasize  His  temporal  aspect,
He is  shown in the act of eating one of His  godly offspring  (p. 68,  p. 118). This
grotesque  image  is  something of a misrepresentation,  as  Saturn's  devouring
of the gods was not that of a cannibal primarily, but intended as an imprison-
ment of their essence.

S aturnus-M alakbel (Palmyra, 2 nd c .  ce)

Raphael's depiction of Saturn  (next page)  is quite interesting,  as he  shows
Saturn seated with the toga, bearing the scythe, and riding in a chariot pulled
by a pair of serpentine dragons. This calls to memory the images of the Islamic
Zuhal, who stands atop a serpent or dragon. As noted previously, here  Saturn
is not conquering or slaying the dragon; rather, He has leashed the dragon and
uses it as His vehicle. This indicates that Saturn is aligned with the chthonic and
chaotic forces of His environment, and that they are subject to His control.

66

S aturn  (18 th  c .  c e  L isinio,  from 16 th  c .  c e  Raphael)

Saturn,  for  the  Romans,  also  manifests  as  the  planetary  body,  which  is
named for  Him.  It  is  important to  note  that  in  Roman  culture,  there was  no
distinction  between  the  deity  as  an  anthropomorphic  entity,  the  deity  as  a
concept, or the deity as a planet. Venus, for example, was understood to be love
itself, as well as a beautiful woman, and a planet. In a similar vein, Saturn was
understood to be a grim grey god in chains in Tartarus, a cosmic principal, and
a malevolent planet that caused harm and injury to all that it shone upon. The
planet was believed by the Romans to be tremendously inauspicious. Propertius
reports in the Elegiarum (iv,i,86): Etgraue Satumi sidus in omne caput (The star of
Saturn is heavy on all heads). Likewise, Lucan states in the Pharsalia (1,651-652):
Summo si frigida caelo Stella nocens nigros Satumi accenderet ignis  (From the  cold
heavens, the hateful Saturnine star shines brightly).

It  is  clear  that  in  His  planetary  form,  Saturn  was  disliked  by  those  who
followed astrology,  and that  His  "star" was  feared to  bring bad luck to  all on
whom it 'shone.' Saturn's negative astral influence continues to be a theme in
Hermetic  texts,  and  finds  strong  parallels  in  the  Islamic  and  Indian  cults  of
Saturn. This will be discussed further in Section Two.

67

The  Demiurg e  Saturn
Saturn,  not surprisingly,  is  a significant figure  in the Gnostic  religions of the
classical  period.  The  term  'Gnostic'  refers  to  a broad  group  of mystery cults
which  embraced  a  common  set  of terms  and  ideas,  but  Gnosticism  never
became  as  monolith  as  the  Christian  religion,  which  eventually  supplanted
and  suppressed  the  Gnostic  movement.  A very basic  summary  of the  classi-
cal Gnostic myth could be stated thusly:  in the beginning, there is  Primordial
Light sometimes called the pleroma 'perfect fullness,' or alternately, the kenoma
'perfect emptiness.' Beyond the light, there is the darkness of undifferentiated
Chaos.  From  Chaos  there  emerges  a  consciousness,  the  Demiurge  ('Divine

D etail from 'S aturn'  by P. P. R ubens

68

Architect')  which upon  gaining self-awareness,  creates  six Archons  ('spiritual
rulers'), to serve as its helpers. Together, the Demiurge and its Archons gener-
ate the  seven celestial realms, which include the material world as part of the
lowest  realm.  They  further  create  entire  populations  of divine  and  angelic
beings to fill the seven realms, and eventually create human and animal life on
earth. Gnostic tradition suggests that the Demiurge's appearance was, howev-
er, an aberration of the natural order,  and that the spiritual pleroma/henoma is
essentially in opposition to the material cosmos. This being the case, many (not
all) Gnostic movements vilified the flesh, and sought to suppress it in order to
augment  or  nourish  the  spirit.  This  hatred  of the  material  world  may  have
been borrowed from Christianity, where it likewise exists.

Despite  the  Hellenistic  language  used  by  many  Gnostic  groups,  the
Saturnine  deity  had  connections  to  the  Abrahamic  religious  tradition.  The
Demiurge, for example, was understood to be the deity who revealed the Torah
to Moses, and so the Jewish religion is understood by many Gnostic writers to
be thoroughly Demiurgic. This makes sense, especially given the cosmo-centric
nature of the Torah, which emphasizes the importance of the material world,
and which  is  largely  silent  about  the  spiritual  afterlife.  Moses  is  considered
to be  a  Saturnine  prophet,  a revealer of laws written  by the  cosmic  architect.
Christianity, by contrast, is a pleromic religion, in that it suppresses the cosmic
nature of the human in favor o f  'spiritual' nature.

Many  of  the  classical  Gnostic  movements  identified  Saturn  with  the
Demiurge,  the  cosmic  architect.  This  association  occurs  explicitly as  a  result
of  Saturn's  association  with  the  Hermetic  or  Neo-Platonic  rule  over  the
seventh  heaven.  It  also  occurs  implicitly through  Saturn's  supposed  associa-
tion with the deity of the  Old Testament, which  is  echoed later in the  Picatrix
tradition that  Saturn  is  lord of the  Jews, via their  celebration  of the  Sabbath.
These  associations  are  evident  when  one  examines  several  texts  that  record
Gnostic beliefs. Saturn, as the Demiurge, is called by several names in Gnostic
tradition.  Most  commonly,  He  is  called laldabaoth,  which  is Aramaic  for  'son
(yald) of chaos  (baoth).' This is a reference to the Gnostic tradition that Saturn
emerged from the primordial Chaos, which He later uses to create the cosmos
and  its  creatures.  Saturn  is  also  referred to  in  some  more  polemical texts  as

69

Saklas  ('fool');  and  Samuel  (Venomous  one  of God'  or  'blind  one  of God'),  an
angelic name known from Hebrew tradition. Less commonly, other texts refer
to the Saturnine deity as Abrasax, Abraxas, or Ariael ('Lion of God').

The  Gnostic text entitled "The  Origin  of the World”  directly identifies  the
seven powers, meaning the Demiurge and six Archons, with the seven planets.
It reads:

Seven appeared in chaos, androgynous. They have their masculine names
and their feminine names. The feminine name is Pronoia (Forethought)
[and the masculine name is]  Sambathas, which is 'week'. And his son is
called Yao: his feminine name is Lordship.  Sabaoth: his feminine name
is  Deity. Adonaios: his feminine name is  Kingship.  Elaios: his feminine
name is Jealousy. Oraios: his feminine name is Wealth. And Astaphaios:
his  feminine  name  is  Sophia  (Wisdom).  These  are  the  seven  forces  of
the seven heavens of chaos. Now the prime parent Yaldabaoth,  since he
possessed  great  authorities,  created  heavens  for  each  of his  offspring
through verbal  expression  -  created them  beautiful,  as  dwelling places
-  and  in  each  heaven  he  created  great  glories,  seven  times  excellent.
Thrones and mansions and temples, and also chariots and virgin spirits
up to an invisible one and their glories, each one has these in his heaven;
mighty armies of gods and lords and angels and archangels - countless
myriads - so that they might serve.16

One also finds Saturn associated directly with Ialdabaoth. The Gnostic text The
Secret Booh of John, for example, identifies Saturn with the planetary realms and
the days of the week. It reads:

Yaldabaoth  is  the  first  ruler,  who  took  great  power  from  his  mother.
Then he left her and moved away from the place where he was born. He
took  control  and  created  for  himself other  realms  with  luminous  fire,
which still exists. He mated with the mindlessness in him and produced

authorities for himself ...Yaldabaoth stationed seven kings, one for each
sphere of heaven, to reign over the seven heavens, and five to reign over
the depth of the abyss... The rulers created seven powers for themselves...
This is the sevenfold nature of the week.17

The planetary associations of the seven powers with the seven heavens is appar-
ent  in  other  Gnostic  (or  anti-Gnostic)  works.18  The  Christian  author  Origen
investigated the  Ophite  Gnostic  sect,  interviewing  its  members  and  reading
some  of their  texts,  as  part  of his  research  into  'heretical'  movements.  It  is
clear both from the actual Gnostic gospels and the writings of such authors as
Origen that Saturn and the other six planetary Archons were considered to be
the controlling forces of the material cosmos,  as well as the creators of mate-
rial  life.  Upon  death,  the  soul  of the  Gnostic  initiate  was  to  ascend  towards
the  successive  planetary  realms,  armed  with  the  various  passphrases  that
would  allow  them  to  pass  through  that  kingdom.  It  stands  to  reason  that  if
one  had  only learned the  first  three  passphrases,  then  they would be  able  to
enter the celestial realm of the fourth Archon, but not be able to pass  further.
By  contrast,  the  soul  of a  non-initiate  would  be  unable  to  ascend  past  even
the  lowest  (lunar)  celestial  realm,  and  be  forced  to  reincarnate  in  the  mate-
rial world. Surprisingly, Origen records some of the (allegedly) Ophite Gnostic
incantations used to access the Saturnine realm, ostensibly after death. In his
polemical work  Contra  Celsum,  he  shares  some  of the  Gnostic tradition  of the
day (6.31):

Further,  if anyone  wants  to  better  understand  the  practices  of those
magicians,  through  which  arcane  secrets  they  endeavor  to  mislead
people, with mixed success, then listen to the secret teaching which the
Gnostics  receive  after  passing  through  the  spiritual  gates,  which  are
governed by the archons. At the First Gate, say:  Hail,  Solitary King! You

are the first power, the darkening of sight, utter destruction,  upheld by
wisdom  and  foresight,  by which  I  am  purified.  [...]  Hail,  lord,  let  it  be
so!' At the Second Gate, they shall find Ialdabaoth. Say, 'Hail, Ialdabaoth,
first and seventh, fearless, and born to rule. Your mind is clear and pure.
You are  a  perfect  son  [to  Chaos],  holding the  sigil  of life,  and opening
the sealed gate to your realm. Again I pass through your realm. Peace be
upon me, lord, let it be so!' [translation mine]

It  is  important  to  clarify  that  while  most  Gnostic  groups  considered  the
Demiurge to be an inferior being to the perfect unity of the pleroma/kenoma,
the  Saturnine  deity  (Ialdabaoth)  is  not  an  enemy  of humanity -   indeed,  the
deity  is  considered  to  be  the  parent  of the  material  cosmos.  Most  Gnostics,
however,  in their rejection of the material cosmos,  rejected its  maker as well,
and so  He  is vilified as being somehow 'stupid' or 'foolish', which is  a curious
point of view.  Indeed,  the  Saturnine  deity is  understood to be  an  emanation
of Chaos, but Chaos is the origin of Cosmos in Gnostic thought -  it is not at all
antagonistic towards it. Cosmic life itself is subject to change (Chaos), it is not
the perfect spiritual stasis of the pleroma. Curiously, the Valentinian Gnostics
presented  a  similar  but  different  paradigm,  in  which  the  Demiurge  rules  all
the celestial realms  except for earth, which  is held by a renegade Archon  (the
Devil).  Thus  the  seven  planetary  realms  are  at  odds  with  the  earth,  and  so
Saturn  is  the  distant  king who  seeks  to  "save"  the  initiate  from  the  cycle  of
rebirth. It is rare for Saturn to take on a salvific character, but in this tradition
(at least) that is the case.

Descriptions  of  Ialdabaoth  depict  him  as  a  great  lion-headed  serpent,
for which  reason  he  is  sometimes  called 'Ariael'  (lion  of God).  This  is  clearly
a draconic  image,  and  is  found on  some  Gnostic  gems  and  scrolls;  this  indi-
cates  that  some  magicians  of the  Hermetic  tradition  were  using  the  image
of the  Demiurge as a talisman. As the architect and controller of the material
cosmos,  the  Demiurge  and His Archons would be the logical forces to  appeal
to,  in  order  to  create  effective  change  in  the world.  The  idea  of appealing  to
the Archons would have horrified many Gnostics, but Origen nevertheless was
able to  access  and cite  the  incantations  used above,  and the  frequency of the

72

lion-serpent image in Hermetic texts and talismans indicates that Origen was
not  fabricating  the  idea  that  some  renegade  Gnostics  rejected  the  pleromic
model, choosing rather to serve the Demiurge than to resist Him.

In summary, the Saturnine deity had a powerful influence on the formation
of Gnosticism, though the various Gnostic movements varied considerably on
the nature and role of Saturn/Ialdabaoth. It is evident that the Saturnine deity
was connected with Chaos, and that He was understood to be an architect and
builder of the material realm, its associated celestial heavens, and the inhabit-
ants thereof. The Demiurge was also believed to interact with humans through
magic, but also through religious traditions  (such as Judaism),  and to seek to
cultivate a positive relationship with humanity.

Saturn in the I ndian  Tradition

It may be in India alone where the Saturnine cult has survived since ancient

times. Master of the planets,  Lord Sani  (Saturn)  remains a prominent deity
in Indian religion, astrology, and popular culture. Sani, also called Shaneshwar,
has had established temples  and devotional practices that go back thousands
of years.  Unlike  the  study of the  Islamic  Zuhal,  or the  Classical  Saturnus,  the
study  of the  cult  of Lord  Sani  is  not  limited  to  old  texts  and  archaeology;  it
does not rely on reconstructions,  clever theories, or linguistic wrangling. One
of the  great joys  of studying the  figure  of the  Saturnine  deity in  India is  that
one gets to examine a living tradition, to visit thriving temples, and to speak to
practitioners who  have  inherited spiritual  practices,  mantras,  and pujas  that
genuinely can be traced to antiquity in an unbroken line.

All those who follow Indian jyotisha,  sometimes called Vedic  astrology,  are
aware of the influence of the navagraha, Sanskrit for 'nine seizers.' These are the
principal planets that are said to control fate, which are Surya (the Sun), Soma
(the  Moon),  Mangala,  (Mars),  Budha  (Mercury),  Brihaspati  (Jupiter),  Shukra
(Venus),  Sani  (Saturn),  Rahu and  Ketu  (the  shadow planets).  These grahas or
seizers are understood to be both actual deities, as well as celestial bodies that
can  be  observed.  The  Indian  jyotisha  practices were  developed very early on,
and whether or not they influenced the Classical tradition  (evidence suggests
not), they absolutely influenced the Islamic tradition to a certain extent.

75

Lord Sani  appears  in  a number of Hindu texts,  both  ancient and contem-
porary, usually in conjunction with the other navagraha. The best known text
dedicated solely to him is the Sani Mahatmya, which was adapted into English by
jyotisha scholar and practitioner, Dr. Robert Svoboda, as The Greatness of Saturn:
A Therapeutic Myth. Sani has also been the subject of other more recent studies,
such as Liz Greene's Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil (1976)  and David Knipe's
"Softening  the  Cruelty of God:  Folklore,  Ritual,  and the  Planet  Sani  (Saturn)
in Southeast India”  (1996). The titles of these three works by Svoboda, Greene,
and Knipe are very telling: they suggest that Sani is a glorious being (mahatma),
but that He has a very dark nature  ("devil”, "cruel”).  Hinduism,  perhaps better
than other religious  systems,  seems able to reconcile  some  seemingly contra-
dictory traits in its deities, so that a god or goddess is at once both gentle and
savage, kindly and sadistic. In Western culture, this might be seen as a kind of
dualism,  but Hindu scholars  have long taught that divine beings -  devas  and
asuras  -   are  considerably  more  complex  than  mortals.  Sani  is  an  exemplary
deity when  it  comes  to  the  personification  of both  misfortune,  even  cruelty,
but strangely also mercy for those who show Him the appropriate respect.

Indian traditions generally hold that Sani is the greatest of the malefic enti-
ties. In fact, contemporary Hindu tradition goes even further -  Sani is said to
be evil. Knipe (232) discusses this crux in detail:

Being planets and rulers of days, [Sani, Rahu, and Ketu] are transcendent
sources of evil. But more importantly, this is a religion that prizes devo-
tion  above  all other avenues  to  salvation.  Demons,  even  if worshipped,
praised, and adored, are still unpredictable. Gods and goddesses, on the
other  hand,  are  often  amenable  to  devotional  contracts  and  thrive  on
human advances from which demons  shrink.  Sani is  malevolent,  cruel,
even harsh, but fair. 'He is the same for everyone,' is a much used phrase
in  Telugu.  The  dark  planet  (as  well  as  all  the  others)  is  endowed with
a personality,  physique  and biography,  and the  status  of devata allows
him to be approached, albeit cautiously, worshipped, and in a few cases
even elevated to a personal deity.

76

Interestingly, having acceded to this personification of evil, the worship-
per  of Sani  proceeds  to  reinforce  his  negative  features,  as  if it  were
incumbent upon humans to valourize that which they fear. The prince of
darkness,  deified,  is nourished by the essence of darkness, black. What
is  given  to  Sani  is  said to  be  something priya,  dear  to  him,  beloved by
him, the colour black, his colour, things of iron, his metal, and above all
the brown oil of sesame (taila) or the unhusked sesame seeds themselves
(tila, Telugu nuvvulu). Therefore  gifts to this crude,  recondite presence
reinforce  his  interior qualities -  darkness,  slowness,  tenacity,  a sinewy
strength -  even as they remind devotees of the death they desire to post-
pone.

Nevertheless,  Sani is not worshipped exclusively as a malevolent and destruc­
tive  force,  but  also  a  deity who  is  capable  of great  benevolence.  In  the  Sani
Mahatmya,  despite all the suffering the various mortals and immortals suffer,
Sani's  black  influence  ultimately  leaves  them  in  a  better  state,  even  if that
state  is  one  of death.  It  must  be  remembered  that  in  the  Dharmic  religions
which accept a view of reincarnation, it is better to die  (and be reborn) than to
continue a life accruing bad karma, which would result in a negative rebirth.

Readers may want to recall here the story of the King and his 72 nobles from

the curious Islamic text, the Kitab al-Ustuwwatas discussed in Chapter One.

Saturnine  Theophany
Sani's  biography  is  revealing.  His  father  is  Surya,  the  solar  deity,  while  His
mother is Chaya, a goddess of shadow, and an emanation -  literally, the shad­
ow (Slct. chaya) -  of the goddess Saranya, a cloud deity. As the son of deities that
represent the sun and darkness, Sani Himself becomes a nocturnal solar deity,
sometimes called the  Black Sun.19 Sani combines elements of both aspects,  as
He has the blasting glare of a sun god, but His light is inverted into darkness.

19  Lucan,  P h arsalia  (1,651-652):  sum m o  s ifr ig id a   caelo  Stella  nocens  nigros  S a tu m i  accenderet  ignis.

“From the cold heavens, the hateful Saturnine star shines brightly.”

77

Sani is the brother of the death god, Yama, and so He is associated with death
and has  a chthonic  function.  Indian  textual  and popular tradition  holds  that
His guna  (nature)  is darkness  (Skt.  tamas),  and this is  not merely His  internal
humors,  since  even  His  coloring  is  black or  cobalt.  The  Yavanajataka  (135-136)
describes His appearance having:

Brown, inscrutable eyes. He is strong, but his head hangs down and his
limbs  tremble.  He  is  tall  and has thick,  rough and dreadful hair,  and
nails and teeth which are discoloured and broken. He is mean and very
irascible;  his  actions  are  evil. Accustomed to hatred,  He  is  a malicious
master. In his black garments and looking like [collyrium], thin and lazy
[Shanaiscara] has abandoned joy. His essence is of sinew. 2 0

Sani's  description  in  the  Sani Mahatmya  is  strikingly similar.  The  translation
reads:

Lord  Saturn  is  tall,  black,  long-limbed  and  emaciated,  with  reddish-
brown eyes, large teeth and nails,  prominent veins,  a sunken  stomach,
a  long  beard,  matted locks,  and  profuse  course,  stiff body  hair.  He  is
lame and his limbs are rigid; his constitution is [cold and dry]. Intensely
harsh,  he  is  cruel  in  authority,  and  his  gaze,  which  is  directed  down-
ward, is utterly terrifying.

Further,

[Saturn  is]  Lord  of the  sinews  and  nerves,  of the  west,  of Saturday,
and of the  constellations  Capricorn  and Aquarius,  he  is  also  known  as
the  Slow,  Son of Shadow,  the Angular,  the  Black,  the  Endless,  the  End
Causer, the All-Devouring, the Steady, the Controller, the Famished, and
the Emaciated.

Using  the  technique  of repetition,  which  has  been  employed  above  in  the
Islamic  section,  there  are  certain  patterns  that  appear  (marked  in  bold).
Saturn  is  tall,  sinewy,  rough of appearance,  and His  personality is  malicious,
cruel,  even  evil.  He  appears  to  be  a  grim  and unforgiving  lord.  We  note  also
that Sani is restrained in His movements (lame), and that He is Himself a force
of restraint. He is said to be slow, and his nature is cold. Clearly, there are some
strong parallels between the  Indian understanding of Saturn,  and the way in
which the Classical and Islamic cultures understood the same deity.

Sani's titles say much about his role in Indian religion. As noted previously,
these include the Endless, the End Causer, the All-Devouring, the Steady,  and
the Controller. In Vedic astrology, Saturn serves as the great malefic, the bring-
er of ill-fortune. In all the texts, it is His gaze that is feared. When He was born,
His  gaze  fell  on  His  father,  causing  an  eclipse.  The  Sani  Mahatmya  provides
several brief anecdotes where Sani's gaze struck various deities, causing them
great harm -  even the greatest deities, such as Shiva and Rama, are not exempt-
ed  from  Sani's  power.  According  to  astrology,  as  Saturn  passes  through  the
horoscope of each person, it is said that His glance falls on them, which invari-
ably  brings  trauma  of some  degree.  Saturn  may  perpetually  afflict  a  person
due to a negative  situation on their horoscope, which is termed Sanidosa.  But
Saturn also afflicts all people, as His planet transits through the constellations,
and so when eventually His power comes to rest on a person, it is said to last 7
½ years.21 The bigger the amount of bad karma (or
sin,  if that  concept  is  easier  to  grasp)  the  person
has accrued, the greater their suffering is likely to
be. A saint or mystic may suffer as much as a crim-
inal or materialistic person, but it is thought to be
less  likely  for  this  to  happen,  as  the  saint/mystic
will generally have better karmas.

That  said,  Sani's  devotees  are  unapologetic
for His  influence,  and even tragedies  such  as the

S ani  (ms  Lagnacandrika)

textbook, as this work is primarily a comparative study.

death of an innocent child will be understood as the result of Sani's black gaze.
Further,  Sani's  malevolence  is  not always  personalized as the misfortune of a
single person. Knipe (221)  states:

A description  [...]  of the effect of Sani's  dominance  over  a year is  simi­
larly  brutal:  drought,  crop  failures,  dust  storms,  diseases  and  famine
are continuous.  In these chapters,  Sani is cosmic malevolence.  Everything
disgusting,  debased or  inauspicious,  from  rivers  and regions  to  plants
and animals is ruled by Sani  [italics mine, for emphasis].

Sani is thus a bringer of chaos, of suffering and trauma on a cosmic level.  His
black gaze can see piercingly to afflict a single person, but also an entire region
can suffer if He wishes so. In many ways, the only difference between Sani and
a demon  (raksasa)  is that Sani can be  negotiated with,  propitiated,  and molli-
fied. Unlike the demon, He absolutely cannot be compelled, and His vengeance
is said to be terrible if He is aggravated.

Such aggravations can and do occur. There are many times when a spiritual
tradition  or  teacher  needs  to  convey  certain  difficult  or  complex  truths  and
lessons, but they simply cannot be effectively conveyed as abstract concepts or
raw information.  Rather,  they are  best expressed through  a  narrative,  which
encodes the subtleties and nuances that a student will grasp as part of a story.
Such  stories  are  often  culture-centric,  and even  deeply tied to  a language.  In
a similar way, the same is true for even  secular narratives. Take  Shakespeare,
for example -  no  one would dare to  argue  that his works  are  as  accessible  or
as  meaningful when  read in  Russian  or Chinese,  because  much of his humor
and meaning is rooted in the popular culture of his day, and also in the 'street
language' of 16th/17th century England. Even to native speakers of English today,
some  (much?)  of Shakespeare's meaning is lost. The  same is  all the more true
for  the  ancient  religious  texts  -   the  Torah  or  Quran  or  Vedas  are  no  longer
truly 'themselves' once they are translated, and it is dangerously naive to argue
otherwise. Yet a diligent, careful reading of a translation can still yield tremen-
dous  amounts  of information,  especially if one  takes  time  to  understand the
history and context of the source culture. This is not to suggest that one cannot

80

use translations to learn spiritual lessons, only that one must be very cautious
in how one goes about such a study.

In the case of Sani, the traditional tale Sani Mahatmya communicates to its
reader certain truths about Lord Sani. With the obligatory warning given that
we are discussing a text in translation,  it would be helpful to provide an over-
view of the nature of this story, because it allows considerable insight into how
the devotees of Lord Sani view the deity.22

The tale begins with King Vikrama, the just ruler of Ujjayini, who had gath-
ered  many  religious  sages  and  scholars  to  his  court.  On  one  fateful  day,  the
King sponsors a colloquium in which the various priests of the nine planetary
deities (navagaraha) debated which of the nine was supreme. It will come as no
surprise  that  each  of the  priests  asserted the  superiority of their  own  divine
patron,  and so  a lively discussion  took place.  But when  it came to the pandita
(scholar)  of the  Saturnine  deity,  King Vikrama was  obliged  to  hear  a  rather
gloomy and austere discussion on the  generally unfavorable nature and cruel
personality of Lord  Sani.  The  King was  troubled by the  pandita's words,  and
when  the  colloquium  ended,  Vikrama  mused  aloud  that  Saturn  was  a  truly
awful being,  as  much  a bane  to  his  own  people  as to  his  enemies. Yet  as  fate
would have it, Sani was passing overhead at that moment and heard the insult.
Descending to earth,  He confronted King Vikrama and turned His black gaze
on  him,  cursing  him  to  suffer  until  he  had  atoned  for  insulting  the  deity.
Indeed,  thereafter  King Vikrama lost everything -  his home,  his  sovereignty,
his dignity -  as  Lord Sani's wrath pursued him, grinding him lower and lower
into the dirt.  Eventually, after seven and a half years, when King Vikrama had
paid the  full measure  of his  folly,  Lord Sani  restored him to his  former  glory.
Vikrama  begged  the  Saturnine  deity  to  never  again  torment  another  living
being as He had tormented the king. Sani replies by telling Vikrama about the
various  deities who  have  suffered under  His  black  gaze.  Nevertheless,  at the
king's prayer,  Sani agrees to spare anyone the worst of His power if they read
this  sacred legend  (Sani  Mahatmya)  on  Saturdays,  and  performed  devotional

81

activities for Sani on Saturday. The text provides a list of examples of activities
which are pleasing to this terrifying deity.

This  tale  is very efficient,  because  it  has  two  major  sections  that  relate  to
Saturn.  First,  the  pandita's  lecture  on  Lord  Sani  is  quite  detailed,  providing
an  overview  of the  background  of the  god's  birth,  His  nature,  His  appear-
ance,  areas  of influence,  and the  rites  by which  He  is worshipped.  Second,  it
demonstrates in vivid detail how even the rich and powerful are vulnerable to
Sani's influence.  In other words,  if a just and righteous king such as Vikrama
can be harmed by Sani,  or worse,  if Sani afflicts even the other gods, then the
reader understands that mere mortals are utterly helpless before so terrifying
a being. There is  no escape -  in time,  all fall under  Sani's  influence. This tale,
however, is not entirely hopeless. It makes very clear that Sani's influence, once
accepted, can be mitigated through particular actions and practices which are
relatively easy to perform, even for very marginalized people. Moreover, if one
actually welcomes Lord Sani's influence, then the trauma of His gaze becomes
a purification which alleviates the worshipper of the negative karmas (spiritual
attachments) which they have accumulated.

Saturnine  Mag ical  Practices
In  order to  show  Lord  Sani  the  proper  respect,  and to  undertake  those  prac-
tices by which one is able to mitigate Sanidosa,  a devotee must be aware of His
attributes and preferred materials. Sani's colors are black, blue, and sometimes
dark grey and dark brown. The sapphire is His sacred stone, and so His devo-
tees will often be seen to wear sapphire jewelry of some kind. The metal sacred
to  Saturn  is  iron,  and  so  His  idols  (murtis)  are  sometimes  simple  iron  nails;
devotees might also wear iron jewelry, such as a chain or bracelet. As with most
Hindu deities,  Sani is identified with several animals that serve as  His vahana
(vehicle or mount). The most prominent is the crow,  a black and ugly bird.  In
many cultures,  the crow is perceived (perhaps correctly)  as  a bird of ill-omen.
Other  vehicles  are  the  tortoise,  the  buffalo,  and  rarely,  the  elephant.  These
latter three animals are all sluggish, ponderous animals, and very resilient.

As  mentioned  above,  unlike  the  cults  of Zuhal  and  Saturn/Cronos,  which
survive  largely  in  memory,  the  cult  of Sani  is  very much  a living  institution.

82

Sani even enjoys a small but visible presence in  Indian media and cinema.  In
the Indian region of Kuchanoor, Sani is worshipped as the primary deity, and
has a prominent temple, Kuchanur Suyambu Sri Saneeswara Bhagavan, which
is  open to the  public  for visitation. At such places,  devotees will perform  reli-
gious  practices,  and also  request that  professional  clergy  (brahmins)  perform
Sani worship (pujas) on their behalf, usually to negate a perceived Sanidosa or
other malefic  influence.  For those who cannot visit a temple  due to  distance,
Sani products and pujas are widely available on the internet today.

As an example,  a popular yantra-vending site advertises the power of Lord

Sani's yantra, saying:

When it is creating positive impact by being positioned in a benefic state,
this Yantra  stimulates  it to  get further  favorable,  and when  it  is  creat-
ing  negative  impact by being positioned in  a malefic  state,  this Yantra
neutralizes it and eventually eliminates it. The bottom-line of this influ-
ence is to please Saturn, and turn it favorable for its host. In astrological
beliefs, a malefic Saturn is unparalleled to the malefic state of any other
planet in the entire planetary system. It speaks length for the intensity of
adversity it has on someone when it is malefic. Usually, one faces lots of
obstacles and there are failures in all aspects. Almost everything, which
should otherwise be going up, scales down. Its ill-effect can also be sensed
with the increased frequency of health problems, which can sometimes
get too  chronic  to  heal.  Sani Yantra has  been  observed,  approved,  and
recommended by astrology for such cases, including for situations when
Saturn  is  in transit or is causing the long-term 'Saadesati' effect.  Other
Benefits  Possession  of Sani Yantra confers  one with  success  in  profes-
sion  or business  and all worldly comforts. Also, it helps one  rise higher
and higher to eventually reach and sustain on top of the scale.23

It  is  clear  from  reading this  description  that the yantra-crafter  is  not merely

23  http://www.kaalsarpdosh.com/aapkikundli/shop/yantra-for-business-growth/shani-

83

emphasizing the negative or adversarial aspects of Saturn, but also suggesting
that Saturn can turn bad luck into good fortune,  and assist with the daily and
worldly needs of His devotee.

Some  Sani practices  (bhakti)  can be performed privately. As  Sani  is held to
be a shadow deity, it is advised to perform them in secret, as this is more pleas-
ing to the deity. Examples of long-standing Sani bhakti includes:

■   Giving charity on Saturday, especially of black grain or sugar.
■   Caring for ugly or ill-favored trees, especially on Saturday.
■   Reciting the Sani Mahatmya story on Saturday.
■   Reciting Sani's mantra daily: Om Sham Shri Sanaischaraya Namah,

and especially on Saturday.

■   Wearing an iron nail, or other iron jewelry.

While any of these practices can be performed on a daily basis, the majority are
held to be  considerably more  potent if performed on  Saturday,  as  that day is
sacred to Him.

Saturnine Gnosis

The Spiritual Path

The  reader  should be well aware that since the 19th century,  there has been

a tremendous  surge of interest in the  paranormal. This  may be the result
of anthropology  seriously  examining  the  beliefs  and  practices  of many  new
spiritual systems that traditional European  schools had previously dismissed
as  superstition.  In  any  case,  the  contemporary  seeker  of the  mysteries  faces
a  considerable  number  of schools,  systems,  and  traditions,  which  claim  to
offer  esoteric  truths  to  their  respective  students.  Many  of these  traditions
originally centered in  (e.g.) Asia or Africa now have considerable internation-
al  followings,  and  a  diverse  body  of practitioners  that  includes  people  of all
ages,  genders, and professional or educational backgrounds.  Some are clearly
charlatans,  without  any  clear  credentials,  offering  instant wealth,  power,  or
love-spells in exchange for 'donations' by way of PayPal. Others, more genuine,
have spent decades painstakingly finding a qualified teacher,  able to transmit
to  them  gradually the  complex body of practices  necessary to  undertake  and
experience the magic of the tradition. Some, even many of the traditions make
exclusive  claims  to  truth  -   their  teacher  is  'the  best,'  their  deity  is  supreme,
and their  path  is  better  than  all  the  others.  Others,  perhaps  better versed  in
the wide world of the occult, realize that while there may not be many spiritual
masters alive today, there are some genuine teachers within reach, if you take
the time to seek.

89

One of the  saddest developments  in 20th century occultism was  the  rise of
the  new traditions  promising  apotheosis.  This  topic  is  delicate,  but  needs  to
be addressed nonetheless.  Some occult traditions really do have secret knowl-
edge,  and  some  occultists  are  capable  of genuine  magic.  Of this,  there  is  no
question.  Magic  has  its  limits,  like  any  force,  and these  are  often  due  to  the
limitations  of the  magician.  Few traditional  masters  would argue  this  point.
Further,  almost  all of the  traditional occult arts  have  acknowledged the  exis-
tence of supernatural entities, with whom magicians can and do traffic.  In no
text or tradition were these entities ever considered as 'archetypes' or 'projec-
tions' of a magician's will.

Yet  somehow,  with  the  appearance  of figures  like  Aleister  Crowley,  an
increasing number of occultists have arisen, claiming to be master magicians,
or more, deities. Some schools purport to be able to teach someone to become a
deity while they are still physically incarnate. Such claims are alarming because
(a) they lack any substantial or measurable evidence, and (b) the self-professed
masters who  claim to  sell miracles  seem  strangely unable to  direct their own
lives.  Worse  yet,  such  figures  have  created  fast-food  schools  of the  occult
which have  relegated gods and elementals  to  nothing more  than wish-fulfill-
ing genies, rather than powerful and self-existing entities which traditionally
demand respect and sacrifice.

Above all,  this should be understood:  power is  not free. The word 'empow-
erment'  is  thrown  around liberally by many who  seem  to  think that demons
can  be  conjured and bullied into  following orders. That is  hubris.  One  might
suggest that the pig who is fed daily by the farmer probably feels 'empowered,'
but  the  pig will  never  become  a  farmer,  even  though  it  might  eat  the  scraps
that come  from the  farmer's  table.  I  am  not saying that spiritual evolution  is
not possible, but it is dangerous to think that one can declare oneself a master,
or  a  deity,  by  virtue  of acquiring  some  magical  skill.  Demanding  favors  or
power from spirits is a dangerous game, and may not result in the 'ascension'
that  many expect  to  find.  By thinking  that  gods  or  spirits  are  projections  or
egregores,  one  runs  the very  serious  risk of falling  into this  trap.  One  might
discover after death that if the power has not been paid for, the magician will
be consumed in payment. It is better to enter into dealings with spirits or gods

90

with an open and intelligent attitude, trusting that if such entities are willing
to communicate and assist the magician, they will not do so for free. Spiritual
beings have their own agendas, and the wise magician recognizes this and acts
accordingly.

Are  spiritual  beings  actually  interested  in  human  spiritual  evolution?
Certainly, this is a prevailing belief in the greater occult community, but what
evidence  supports  this?  If the  majority of contemporary masters  are  actually
able to summon gods or devils for purposes of self-aggrandizement, then why
are they equally often  struggling to  meet their  own  material or social needs?
Worse, why are they selling materials offering to teach skills that they do not
themselves  seem to  possess? This  is  not to  say that all masters  are charlatans
-   far  from  it.  Those  who  claim  to  teach,  and  profit  from  teaching,  are  often
suspiciously lacking in credibility. A simple Google search will show as much.
But good teachers are nevertheless a great blessing, and if one can find a genu-
ine  spiritual teacher,  they can  offer a  great wealth of techniques  and sugges-
tions, and certainly in some cases, the transmission of gnosis. This cannot and
should not be disputed.

Choosing  a  Spiritual  Path
When  one  decides  to  select a spiritual tradition,  they need to  ask themselves
what  they  hope  to  gain  from  embarking  on  the  spiritual  quest.  If someone
has come to believe in magic, and wishes to gain greater control over their life
and personal circumstances,  all well and good,  but Vajrayana Buddhism may
not be the path for them.  Equally, if someone wishes to establish a daily prac-
tice leading to profound inner tranquility, Vajrayana may indeed be the  path
they are  searching  for.  Is  the  seeker  committed to  a deeper  connection with
the  Supreme Being,  and content in simple yet profound devotional practices?
Then  Sufism  or  Bhakti Yoga may be  good choices.  Not  all esoteric  traditions
actually teach magic, but this does not mean that they are any less valid. Magic
is a valid skill to wish to learn, but similar to a competitive sport, it takes time,
practice,  and  a  certain  degree  of innate  ability.  Many  esoteric  paths  do  not
require  any skill with magic,  and can  still lead their initiate to very profound
spiritual realizations.

91

One  should select a spiritual path with care,  and not without weighing the
risks  and  benefits  associated with  that  path.  I f  a  tradition  is  associated with
a  particular  deity  or  family  o f spiritual  entities,  one  needs  to  know  if  one  is
comfortable with the  requirements o f the tradition. This  holds  especially true
if  one  accepts  the  existence  o f the  gods  or  spiritual  intelligences  as  genuine
phenomena.  In  the  same  way  that  one  might  accept  or  reject  a  position  o f
employment  based  on  one's  understanding  or  knowledge  o f one's  potential
superior in the organization, one needs to assess whether the spiritual patrons
o f a  particular  system  represent  the  values  and  ambitions  one  seeks.  This  is
a  process  that  requires  serious  reflection  in  both  the  head  and the  heart.  On
the  one  hand,  it  is  true  that  ‘you  know when  you  know'  the  right  teacher  or
spiritual  current,  because  you  should  feel  it  in  your  gut.  On  the  other  hand,
one  needs  to  do  one's  reading,  consult  books,  speak  to  other  knowledgeable
teachers  or  students,  and  try  to  understand  what  aligning  with  a  particular
current or school entails. I f  everyone belonging to the school lives a very stable
and happy life - this suggests something about the teaching and energy o f that
current.  I f  the  initiates  o f a  particular  current  are  struggling with  substance
abuse and frequent run-ins with law enforcement,  it suggests  something else
entirely about the nature o f the energy behind this particular current.

One  also  needs  to  carefully consider  the  rules  and  practices  o f a  spiritual
current.  In  many traditional African  currents,  for  example,  blood  sacrifice  is
normal  and  necessary.  A student who  balks  at  such  things  will  not  last  long,
or  not  be  accepted.  This  applies  to  all  major  religions  -   i f  someone  is  really
against  animal  sacrifice,  then  Islam  (and  its  associated  Sufi  orders)  could be
a bad choice as a religion,  given the annual Eid al Kbir sacrifices. That is not to
say that  spiritual  and cultural  norms  cannot be  re-evaluated periodically,  but
cherry  picking  is  best  avoided,  if  one  seeks  to  truly  integrate  into  a  spiritual
current that embraces and endorses such practices.

There is also the question o f how one becomes part o f a living esoteric tradi­
tion. This is a tricky topic, with some sharply divided opinions and much could
(and should) be said about it. While the scope o f the present work will not allow
us  to  elaborate  on  this  matter  too  much,  we  want  to  quickly  state  our  own
position  as  far as  it relates to the  gnosis  found within this book. To become  a

92

devotee  of Saturn,  no  formal  initiation  is  required.  The  information  in  this
work, for example, provides more than enough insight into the role and nature
of the Saturnine deity for someone drawn to its current to establish a meaning-
ful devotional relationship with it. Such a devotional solitary relationship may
develop into an elaborate personal cultus of Saturn and the deity may bestow
great insights and powers. However, if one seeks the most complete Saturnine
transformation,  the  guidance  of a genuine  master or teacher becomes  indis-
pensable. Not only will such a master provide important tools and techniques
which have been acquired and tested over many generations, but more impor-
tantly,  he  will  act  as  the  'physician  of the  heart.'  Such  a  master  has  little  in
common  with  the  usual  western  esoteric  teacher  who  is  at  best  an  esoteric
college tutor and at worst a fraudulent pretender and hoarder of empty titles
and degrees. The physician of the heart is the master who establishes a deep-
ly  individual  relationship  with  the  student  and  removes  the  spiritual  debris
and confusion  from  the  soul  so  that the  initiate  becomes  the  perfect  soil  for
the  divine  (in  this  case  Saturnian)  energies.  The  powers  or conditions which
rule our everyday consciousness  are  so  strong and deceptive that it is  impos-
sible  for us  to bypass  all their traps  and tricks which they have  implemented
to remain in control of the profane I. While we may be able to have success in
following  ritual  instructions  or  even  have  great  spiritual visions  and  experi-
ences through our devotional relationship with the deity, they will remain to a
degree fractured or isolated: To fully replace "the  I of day-consciousness with
the I of night-consciousness” as David Beth states so well, we need to establish
the sacred bond with a genuine teacher. Only through this process of mirror-
ing,  mentoring and monitoring, the  soul can become a perfect mirror for the
Saturnian  energies  enabling the  initiate to manifest the whole  range  of their
powers.

Trafficking with spirits in itself can be of course highly problematic. Entities
which claim to be benevolent or auspicious may not actually be so.  In a sense,
one is actually fortunate if a spirit admits up front that it is not auspicious or
kindly -  that is better than finding out the hard way. One may be pledged to a
spirit, serve it devotedly, and yet find at the end of the long road that it has all
been for naught. This is where the grimoire tradition is very helpful, insofar as

93

it  is  one  thing to  receive  'gnosis'  from  something claiming to  be  Lilith which
indeed conforms  to  the  generous  surviving  traditions  of Lilith,  whereas  it  is
more  risky to pledge oneself to some  spirit which has no persona or cultus to
be researched. The reader is likely aware of the many different cults dedicated
to supposedly ancient spirits (like Lilith), which under scrutiny bear no resem-
blance  at  all  to  the  ancient  deities  in  question.  Personal  gnosis  is  good,  but
it's even better when it matches the practices of the original cultists to at least
some degree. When people assert that they speak to a Lilith, who claims to be a
kindly fertility goddess, it's evident that they are being deceived by something
that is clearly masquerading to take advantage of their ignorance. Caveat cultor.
A large reason for writing this particular study is to provide a resource on the
Saturnine  deity,  so that  readers  are better able  to  recognize  and identify His
presence, if they might encounter it.

The Saturnine Deity: A nalysis

The most complex question that this study addresses is this: who -  or what -

is the Saturnine deity? The First Section explored three major cults of that
black  planet,  namely  Classical,  Islamic,  and  Indian.  These  choices  were  not
exclusive, because the Saturnine deity appears in many cultures. Some ancient
star-gazing civilizations, such as Babylon and Egypt, demonstrated awareness
of the dark star. Other cultures, such as the Celts and Germans, had their own
analogues  in  figures  like  Balor  and Ymir.  The  dark  grandfather  of gods  and
mortals is a character that appears in most Indo-European mythologies. Balor,
the  Saturnine  figure  in  Old  Irish  tradition,  is  a  terrible,  cyclopean  monster,
one  of the  demonic  invaders who  attempts  to  conquer  Ireland.  He  is  said to
rule a race of demons (formoire) from a magical glass tower on Inis Tor. Balor's
gaze instantly slays  anyone that He looks upon,  and so He must keep  His eye
closed at all times. His tyranny is ended when His grandson (Lugh) kills Him in

94

battle. The esoteric adept David Beth has also pointed out important Saturnian
aspects of the Germanic Wodan which show parallels to Cronos:

Wodan  as  a  ruler  of the  dead  is  well  established but  as  the  God of the
ecstatic  he  also  keeps  a  close  relationship with  the  living.  His  bi-polar
nature encompasses both the world of the dead and realm of the living
and his devotees are pulled towards him in moments of ecstatic rapture
and transport. This magical magnetism was called Eros of the Distance
by the philosopher Ludwig Klages. In the Fraternitas Borealis Wodan is
addressed as  the  'Innermost'  and the  'Outermost'.  Chained in  magical
sleep,  He  is  the  God in  the  mountain  (to which he  draws  the visionary
dreamers) but He is also the roaming God in the outer spheres, the eter-
nal wanderer.24

Of course,  Saturn  is  not  merely  an  Indo-European  figure,  or  even  an  Indo-
Semitic  figure. The  Saturnine  deity appears  in the  mythologies  and religious
systems  of other  ancient  cultures.  The  Aztecs,  for  example,  revered  Him  as
Tezcatlipoca, the Black Sun, a generally malevolent deity, hobbled by virtue of
a  missing  foot which  was  sometimes  replaced by  a  black  mirror  or  serpent.
Tezcatlipoca, like Sani and Saturn, was for some time considered a major god
of the Aztec  empire,  though  His  reign was  challenged by  His  brother  (rather
than  son).  The worship  of Tezcatlipoca demanded daily human  sacrifice,  for
which  the Aztec  empire  remains  infamous  today.  He  is  a  paradoxical  figure
who  is  both  solar  and  chthonic  in  the  same  moment,  much  like  Lord  Sani.
Curiously, He wears bells arrayed like chains.

Next,  there  is  the Vodou deity  Baron  Samedi,  who  belongs  to the  Guedhe
family of Vodou Gods who embody the powers of death and fertility.  He has a
chaotic  and irascible  character with lewd,  gallows humor.  The  Baron  dresses
in  black,  and  Saturday  (Samedi)  is  sacred  to  Him.  Liminal  places  like  cross-
roads and graveyards are his territory.  He is a popular deity for those in need
of special magical assistance.  In the  esoteric voudon work of David Beth and

24  David Beth in a letter to the author.

95

the  Société  Voudon  Gnostique,  it  is  another  member  of the  Guedhe  family,
Ghuedhe  Nibbho  who  rules  the  Saturnian  sphere.  Not  unlike  Wodan  in  the
Fraternitas  Borealis,  He  is  a deity connected to  both the  dead and the  living.
Within  the  cultus  He  oversees  the  spiritual  death  and  resurrection  of the
initiate  as  a  living  dead,  which  frees  the  cultist  from  the  ruling  order  of the
cosmos.25

This list is meant to demonstrate that the Saturnine deity does exist in other
cultures  and systems beyond those covered in  Section One.  Having looked at
several  cultural  manifestations  of Him,  it  is  clear  that  there  are  serious  and
consistent parallels. At this point, it is good to consider why those parallels exist.
One possibility is that all the myths come from a common cultural source. This
possibility would  make  sense  if the  cultures  were  all  in  close  contact,  which
they were not. Also, if they shared a common site of origin for the Saturn char-
acter,  we  would  expect  to  find that  all  (or  more)  of the  deities  show  similar
traits, when  they clearly do  not.  Indra and Jupiter may be  like Thor,  and they
do share a common Indo-European origin as thunder deities, but Indra is not
Jupiter,  and Jupiter is not Thor. They do not look the same, dress the same, or
have the same icons apart from the storm.

One must next consider the possibility of trade routes, because stories and
myths  can  travel,  but  it  would  be  very  odd  for  merchants  to  spread  stories
about a displaced,  hostile  deity,  instead of the  more  popular  cultural  deities.
Another possibility is that Saturn  somehow represents  a visible phenomenon
or  archetype.  However,  it  is  extremely hard to  explain why multiple  cultures
would imagine the same displaced and alien deity, which has the same peculiar
traits as lameness, chaos, dark colors, cold nature, chains, a connection to the
seventh day of the week,  and a presence or gaze which causes harm or death.
If Saturn could be reduced to an archetype, then we would expect to see even
greater parallels for solar and lunar deities -  but strangely,  those  parallels  do
not generally exist.

We  are  left  then  with  one  logical  explanation:  that  the  Saturnine  deity
appears  in  multiple  mythologies  with  the  same  characteristics  because  the

25  From a private correspondence with David Beth.

96

entity is  real  Saturn is  not only an  archetype or a fable, but instead an  actual
deity  (or  planetary  intelligence,  or  power)  with  which  various  cultures  have
made  contact,  and its common appearance among those cultures  is  evidence
of its genuine existence.

Of course, the Saturnine deity does not merely manifest in ancient mythol­
ogy, but also in the consciousness of more modern thinkers. The great British
author J. R. R. Tolkien created two primary villains for Middle Earth: Morgoth
and Sauron. While these figures appear imaginary, Tolkien was a noted histo-
rian and linguist, and based much of his writing on actual mythology. Morgoth
is  the  black tyrant,  the  general who  seeks  to  enslave  all of earth  and human-
ity.  He  claims  to  be  the  "master  of the  fates  of Arda.”  Garbed  all  in  black,  he
fights  a war  against  the  Valar  (gods)  for  control  of the  cosmos.  His  weapon
is  not the  sword  or  spear,  but  a heavy hammer  named Grond  ("grinder”).  In
that war,  he  is  injured in  his  leg,  and walks  afterwards with  a limp.  Later he
is exiled into the void of night, but will return someday to continue the battle.
Morgoth is succeeded by his lieutenant,  Sauron, whose symbol is the burning
eye, and whose gaze is said to be injurious. The point here is not that Morgoth
or Sauron are real entities, but that the Saturnine deity is such a powerful and
menacing figure that when Tolkien was drafting the  great fantasy epic of the
20th  century,  he  chose  deliberately  to  make  the  chief antagonist  an  utterly,
entirely Saturnine character.

In Section One, one of the techniques that proved useful is the search for points
of repetition. In simple language, some of the traits of the deity will be cultural-
ly-specific: that is expected and unavoidable. However, other traits of the deity
may prove  common  to  several  cultures,  and those  are  the  aspects  that  it will
prove interesting to focus on.  By compiling those universal or common traits,
we will be able to better understand the true nature of the Saturnine deity.

Darkness
In  every  instance  of  the  Saturnine  deity,  there  is  a  profound  connection
between  the  deity  and  darkness.  Darkness  can  be  black,  grey,  or  sometimes

97

cobalt blue. These  symbolic  colors  are echoed in the  clothing of the deity, the
color  of the  deity's  skin,  the  color  of the  deity's  idol,  the  color  of the  deity's
preferred offerings  and sacrifices,  and the  descriptions  of the  deity's  nature.
One should wonder, what does darkness  signify? In terms of semiotics,  dark-
ness is usually connected with night, death, taboo, the unknown, and with the
chthonic  realms.  Darkness  is very rarely a positive  indicator  of a deity -  it  is
not impossible for it to be so, but much more often darkness is indicative (and
evocative)  of sinister energies.  More  importantly,  in those  cultures  described
in this  book in  detail  (Classical,  Indian,  Islamic),  the  color black is  absolutely
chthonic -  it is connected with the underworld, and with negative forces. Even
the images of the  Saturnine deity are connected with darkness,  be it through
the obscuring of his face by the toga, or the darkness of his idol (a black obelisk
or cube).

Trauma
The  Saturnine  deity  is  a  source  of injury.  Almost  every culture  which  recog-
nizes Saturn considers him the  great malefic.  Saturn hurts people,  He causes
pain  and  suffering,  and  the  text  suggests  that  He  enjoys  causing  this  pain.
For the  Islamic and Roman magicians, there is nothing redemptive about the
trauma brought by Saturn. The Saturnine deity injures because it can injure, or
perhaps, because it likes to injure, or because it injures compulsively. The Indian
tradition agrees that Saturn causes great harm, but tries to find some meaning
in the suffering, even if the suffering results in death. Celtic culture, like Indian
culture, connects the trauma Saturn inflicts to his black gaze -  that somehow
the act of Saturn seeing a person is the cause of injury. Overall, this  aspect of
Saturn  is the  most hated and feared of all his traits:  Saturn is pain.  However,
all three great cultures also agree that Saturnine trauma can be predicted and
mitigated.

Chains
Saturn  is  deeply  connected  with  maiming  and  imprisonment.  In  all  the
cultures  noted  here,  the  deity  is  either  injured,  or  lame,  or  chained  in  some
way. His movement is impaired. Simultaneously,  He is the god of restraint, of

98

limitation and chaining. The reason for the maiming or chaining, curiously, is
often related to some conflict: Saturn/Cronos is chained in adamantine fetters,
Sani is wounded, while Zuhal is lame without reason, and Tezcatlipoca's foot is
replaced by a black mirror or serpent. The Classical tradition goes the furthest
by banishing the  Saturnine  deity to Tartarus,  the  black netherworld beneath
the world of the  dead.  Saturn's  chains  are  themselves  used  in  magical  spells
as  a  device,  used  to  restrain  other  people.  Saturn  limits  people,  enterprises,
nations, and forces of nature.

Time
The Saturnine deity is said to be 'ancient,' 'old,' or 'eternal.' As you will remem-
ber, the Greeks in particular called him 'Chronos' and syncretized him togeth-
er with the personification of time. This connection of Cronos to time (chronos)
is not merely Greek -  the Romans acknowledged that Saturn was a divinity of
time, and the Saturnine deity seems to have had a connection with time also in
Islamic literature.  It is well known that the Kaaba itself was the house of idols
in Mohamed's time, and so the Black Stone was very likely the icon represent­
ing the pagan  deity Dahr (time). There  is  a peculiar verse in the Quran which
says: And they say: 'There is nothing hut our life in this world: We die and we live and
nothing  destroys  us  except time.' And  they  have  no  knowledge  of it,  they  only  conjee-
ture’ (Qur'an 45:24). Mohamed is said to have later told his companions, 'Do not
curse Time,  for Time  is Allah.'  In  English,  it sounds  as though Mohamed was
simply attributing the power of fate to Allah, but in Arabic, the verse infers that
the deity whom the Arabs revered as 'Time' was in fact the original chief deity
of the  Kaaba.  Time  is  an  entropic  force which  eventually destroys  all  things,
even stars and suns. As noted previously,  Saturn is considered an agricultural
deity,  but this  is  primarily because  He  is  the  harvest time,  the  reaper,  which
brings an end to all things. This is connected to His death aspect (see below).

Cold
In  several traditions,  Saturn's  star/planet  is  said to  be  cold.  This  is  referring
to His essence or 'humor,' according to the medical wisdom of the Greeks and
Indians.  Coldness  can  be  a  reference  to  age,  to  sluggishness,  but  also  to  the

99

darker half of the year and the northern direction. It is curious that the Winter
Solstice  (21 December)  falls in the middle of the Saturnalia week, and that the
festival is celebrated in the coldest month of the year. In Indo-European mythol-
ogy,  the  predominant belief was  that the  initial  state  of the  black  primordial
Chaos was cold, and even after the appearance of the cosmos, the cold contin-
ues to be associated with darkness, the north, and hostile forces. Cold is asso-
ciated with death, the chill of the grave, the underground (basements,  mines,
ruins), and the underworld.

Disruption
The Saturnine deity is a disruptive being, no less so because He is a projection of
the primordial Chaos. His energy is not conducive to a normal, healthy society.
The  Saturnalia best demonstrates the wildness and social revolt that Saturn's
presence brings when it is unrestrained. Saturn not only causes suffering, but
He also brings social unrest and turmoil. The Saturnine deity does not merely
trouble  individuals,  but  also  entire  regions,  even  the  heavens.  Several  of the
traditions relate that the other planets fear Saturn, and that He disrupts their
powers  and operations.  Saturn's  chaos  is  not always destructive,  however,  as
the Saturnalia festival was not considered a hateful or negative thing -  it was
genuinely celebrated. Saturn sometimes exhibits a certain gallows humor, it is
said, as demonstrated well by the bawdy and ribald humor of Baron Samedi.

A ncestor
This trait is  somewhat curious, but both Islamic tradition and Classical tradi-
tion  identify  Saturn  as  an  ancestor  figure.  The  Romans  held that  (chthonic)
Saturn  is  an  ancestor  figure  of the  Italic  people,  which  the  Gauls  echoed for
themselves in identifying Saturn as Dis Pater. The Greek "Cronos' Mill" incan-
tation addresses Cronos as "ancestor", and the Islamic incantation to summon
a manifestation of Zuhal addresses him as "father and lord." This suggests that
several  of the  cultures  (Greeks,  Romans,  Arabs)  identified  Zuhal  as  having  a
divine connection to them, not unlike how Zeus and Odin are thought to have
been ancestor figures to famous lines of kings and heroes. It should be remem-
bered that while  the Arab  text addresses  Zuhal  as  "father," Arabic  often  uses

100

the term 'father' and 'mother' for  grandparents.26 Saturn  is  not a father deity
so  much  as  an  ancestor deity.  That  is  to  say that  His  cultists  did  not  address
Him usually as father as a Christian addresses ''God the Father.'' Rather, Saturn
is  addressed as  an  ancient and hoary ancestor.  Perhaps  this  term  of address
is  used to make the terrifying entity more approachable and in the hope that
'Grandfather  Saturn'  will  prove  more  kindly  than  not  -   though  admittedly,
this is akin to Lovecraft's cultists using the term of address ''Father Dagon," in
hopes of humanizing an inhuman deity.

Death
Undeniably,  Saturn is a chthonic figure, and all His symbols suggest as much,
such  as  His  covered head,  His  scythe,  His  insistence  on  black  offerings,  and
His  association with the  underground.  The very texts  that  identify  His  areas
of influence indicate that He is to be consulted on matters related to the dead.
In  Indian  tradition,  He  is  brother  to  Death  (Yama),  and  in  the  Roman  and
Greek tradition,  He  rules  over Tartarus,  the  darkest,  most hostile  part  of the
netherworld.  In  Celtic myth,  Balor's  gaze causes  instant death,  as  does  Sani's
in  Indian  tradition.  Likewise,  in Vodou tradition,  Baron  Samedi  is  the  chief
spirit of death. As noted previously, the Roman Saturn, black clad, cowled, and
bearing a scythe,  is the origin of the Christian myth of the 'Grim  Reaper,' not
because  Saturn  was  a  death  deity like  Orcus,  but  because  Saturn  represents
Time, which destroys all things.  Saturn may not be death personified, but He
clearly has  a connection with  the  process  of dying,  and with the  underworld
itself.  Saturn,  in His guise as a planetary spirit or intelligence, also appears in
connection with  medieval operations  of necromancy and black magic,  in  the
grimoire tradition.

The  Black  Cube
In several of these cultures discussed,  Saturn's physical presence in this world
-  his idol, if you will -  is said to be a black stone, cube,  or obelisk. The current
idol  of Sani  at  one  of his  most  prominent  temples  continues  to  be  the  black

26  It is  noteworthy that the  magician  using the  P icatrix invocation  addresses  Saturn  as “[my]
lord father," which is exactly how a grandfather is addressed in some contemporary dialects

o f Arabic.

stone  even  now.  The  Kaaba  itself,  which  was  originally  an  icon  o f the  Time
deity,  is  another  prominent  example  o f the  Black  Cube.  It  is  significant  that
the  black  stone  at the  heart  o f the  Kaaba  is  said to  be  black  iron,  fallen  from
the  stars,  which  according  to  Islamic  lore  makes  it  Saturnine  by  definition.
We  might  ask  why the  Saturnine  deity would  prefer  a  Black  Cube  or  obelisk
as  an  icon.  The  answer,  one  might suspect,  is  related to the  earlier  statement
that the  Saturnine deity is a remnant o f the primordial Chaos, which was cut/
severed from Chaos when the cosmos surged into being. The Cube symbolizes
the cutting,  in that its  straight edges  and angles are clearly artificial and non-
natural.  The  Cube  also  represents  the  maiming  and  constraining  o f Saturn,
and the prison dimension  (Tartarus)  to which the deity is confined. The  Black
Cube  is  simultaneously  the  prison  and  the  throne  o f the  dark  god.  Further,
the  symbol  or  emblem  o f the  Black  Cube  appears  in  many contemporary  art
and  media  projects,  often  as  a  symbol  o f alien  menace  or  alterity.  Examples
include  Clive  Barker's  Hellraiser  cubes,  and the  Leviathan  deity itself.  Even  a
Google search for 'Black Cube' shows an extensive list o f corporations that use
the Black Cube as a symbol, or actual Black Cubes that are installed around the
world.  Other,  more  alarmed minds  have  suggested that the  prevalence  o f the
Black  Cube  phenomena  is  a  subtle  indication  that  the  Cult  o f the  Saturnine
deity remains alive and well.

Sum m ary  Of  Findings
The  Saturnine  deity  demonstrates  a  series  o f very  similar  traits  across  the
cultures  in  which  it  manifests  -  this  is  evident  in  the  pages  above.  Generally
absent  are  such  traits  as  kindness,  warmth,  and  benevolence.  Whatever  the
contemporary magician might wish to think, the great majority o f the ancient
cultures  clearly recognized the  Saturnine  deity as  a very real  force  that  could
not be escaped,  and its attention was more likely to cause trauma and disrup-
tion  than  anything.  This  said,  the  majority o f those  cultures  discussed  devel-
oped ways to placate the  Saturnine deity, either by festival,  sacrifice, or what-
ever actions o f ritual and devotion.  Interestingly, these practices seem to have
worked, because no culture like Rome would have annually practiced so expen-
sive a festival as the Saturnalia for nothing, and Ibn Wahshiyya would not have
risked his  life  to  record  forbidden  practices  i f  he  did not have  personal  expe-

102

rience  of their validity -  and  indeed,  he  says  as  much.  The Aztecs went even
further,  making  the  Saturnine  deity  the  chief deity  of their  empire,  despite
the  daily  cost  of sacrifices  that  they  felt  such  a  deity  demanded.  The  haunt-
ing figure of an old,  grim sovereign, robed in black, crippled, killing or maim-
ing others with his black gaze -  this figure appears to be manifest consistently
across  a wide  range  of diverse  cultures.  Consequently,  this  discussion  must
move to what exactly this entity is, what it wants, and if there is any benefit to
be had from placating or entreating such a grim grey god. Thus far, this study
has relied entirely on scholarly sources and research. At this point, it is neces-
sary to supplement these with esoteric tradition and gnosis.

The Saturnine D e ity:  I nterpretation

Mythology and sacred tradition are ways by which supernatural events in

the  distant  past can  be  understood and described in  human  language.
In  order  to  make  use  of the  lore  of ancient  cultures,  it  is  important  to  reject
a  literalist  binary true/false  attitude,  and  instead  seek  to  understand what  a
particular  story or  symbol is  trying to  communicate.  Otherwise,  there  are  no
ancient systems which will be useful to any reader, because all systems rely on
the language and culture of a particular place and time. Even in contemporary
English  language,  we  say 'sunrise'  and 'sunset,'  even  though through  science
today, we are aware that the sun is neither rising nor setting (as our ancestors
thought),  but for  all practical purposes  it  is  easier to  say this  or 'think' of the
sun as moving across the sky, rather than to imagine the Earth spinning on its
axis. This applies to myths and symbols of the Saturnine deity, as well as to any
religious or spiritual tradition.

On the one hand, this study has just shown three consistent patterns through
which  the  Saturnine  deity manifests  in  human  consciousness.  First,  there  is
the human  manifestation,  in which  Saturn  appears  a grim old man,  robed in

103

black, crippled or lame, with a stern or angry countenance, and bearing a sharp
sickle or sword. Second, there is the planetary manifestation, in which Saturn
appears as a cold, dry,  and shadowy planet that radiates menace. Third, there
is  the  iconic  manifestation,  in  which  Saturn  appears  as  a  black  stone,  cube,
or obelisk. These manifestations are symbolic of Saturn's character,  and were
never meant to be interpreted literally. The ancients did not believe that Saturn
was just an old man, any more than He was 'just' a planet, or 'just' a black iron
cube. What, then, did the ancients intend by these symbols, and what do these
symbols mean to communicate to the initiated reader today?

When we contemplate the nature and power of symbols we should keep in
mind the teachings of David Beth on symbolic thinking and the pandaemonic
world of night consciousness. We believe that his work reveals the most inner
essence and sacredness of the symbol as magical doorway into the most essen-
tial reality. Master A-Logos (David Beth)  says:

The world of symbols is the world of night consciousness.  Against popu-
lar opinion we believe that myths are born from symbols. The true symbol
itself is a revelation of an enthusing power (such as a spirit, a daemonic
essence) and never only a metaphor. The benighted communes with the
powers  of the  living All  and the  encounter,  the  mating  of passive  soul
(initiate,  poet,  visionary)  with  the  active  daemonic  souls  or  essences
triggers  the  manifestation  of a true  symbol. When  symbols  are  glyphs
of ecstatic encounters they form part of a language that communicates
realities which can  never be  approached through conceptual language.
Real  symbols  always  impact  magically  and  thus  have  the  power  to
reawaken the  facility of ecstatic esoteric vision.  For the  rare aristocrats
of the soul they become doorways into the living, daemonic Kosmos.27

It is crucial, first, to state clearly that all the cultures discussed here have accept-
ed that the  Saturnine deity was  an actual entity, which,  in its planetary form,

27  David Beth as quoted from a private communication to the author on the magical effect of

symbols and the nature o f night consciousness.

104

afflicts  all  beings.  Whereas  one  might  possibly ignore  most  of the  gods  that
seemed outside one's personal sphere, all the cultures here considered Saturn's
influence  to  be  an  inevitable  and unenviable  part  of life.  The  worship  of the
Saturnine deity was  not a cathartic exercise or a Freudian operation,  it was  a
literal  cultus  intended to  mitigate  the  greater  and lesser  trauma that  afflicts
nations, gods, and mortals alike. This is a view which the reader should consid-
er carefully, especially because it has been so universally held, and continues to
be held today by many who understand the workings of celestial forces.

To understand the  Saturnine deity as these cultures understood Him,  it is
necessary to investigate the greater cosmology to which many of these cultures
ascribed,  because  this  dark deity did not exist purely independently,  but was
part of a greater tradition or family of traditions.

Chaos
In many of the world's mythologies, before the cosmos came into being, there
was  something  else  which  in  English  we  call  Chaos.  Chaos  is  a  very  Indo-
European  motif,  but occurs  also  in  many other cultures' legends,  such  as the
Sumerian  or  Afro-Semitic  cultures  of the  bronze  and  iron  age  period.  For
example,  readers  of the  Bible will know it from the book of Genesis, where  it
is described as the initial flux of darkness and water, to which Jehovah brings
light  and  shape.  By definition,  Chaos  was  impossible  to  describe,  because  it
was  so fundamentally alien to the cosmos that we have no frame of reference
by which to understand it, because it predated the separation of existence from
non-existence.  Nevertheless, Chaos is frequently described in ancient texts as
an  ocean  of darkness. At  some  point,  for whatever  reason  (traditions  differ),
it  generated the  cosmos,  along with  other  primordial  entities  that  inhabited
the  cosmos,  and  which  themselves  created  other  lesser  beings  such  as  the
gods.  Several of the  ancient cultures held that  Saturn was  one of the  primor-
dial beings. Interestingly, most of the primordials were described as immense
creatures that were  not especially human  in their appearance. While  Islam  is
silent on the origins of Zuhal, the Classical and Indian traditions both hold that
when the Saturnine deity was born, its first recorded act was to injure its male
parent,  and without any provocation.  The  dark deity momentarily asserts  its

105

cosmic dominance, but then is defeated, injured, and exiled to the most distant
edge of celestial and/or chthonic space. The secret meaning of this tradition is
that the Saturnine deity is actually a remnant of the pre-cosmic Chaos, and the
emergence of the cosmos  (or sun  god)  effectively shatters the unity of Chaos.
The  emerging  cosmos  (symbolized  by light)  is  separated  from  Chaos,  which
withdraws, becoming the darkness visible beyond the stars at night. However,
some  of the  Chaos  is  trapped  within  the  cosmos,  becoming  the  primordial
deities. The Saturnine deity is an aspect of Chaos, and so his influence over the
other  planets  is  negating  and  negative;  his  influence  over  nations  is  socially
disruptive; and his influence over mortals is often lethal. The Saturnine deity is
dark-skinned, because Chaos is dark. He is disruptive, because Chaos is disor-
dered.  He is  malevolent and associated with death, because Chaos is inimical
to  all  life.  He  is  an  ancestor  figure,  because  like  the  Chaos  which  generated
Him, He cannot help but create, even as He cannot resist causing destruction.
He is a father, grandfather, or ancestor, because He is one of the first primordi-
a l  to emerge from Chaos. He is a king or tyrant, because He is the greatest of
the emanations of Chaos to remain in the cosmos.

The Saturnine deity, then, is not really an old, dark man. That is a shape or
body that the entity adopts for dealing with its mortal cultists. The actual shape
of the deity, if such a thing could be imagined, would be impossible to describe.
Were an initiate able to perceive it directly, they would see an immense spirit
that is dark and cold, and its resonance would be both chthonic and malevolent.
It may be easier to simply envision the deity as the planet, which is in some way
its current physical manifestation in the cosmic world. Of course, the planet is
a mass of minerals and ice, but that is merely the aspect visible to physics -  just
as a human is 'merely' a mass of minerals and liquids in solid form.

Nevertheless, the Saturnine deity is restrained, chained, and maimed. In all
the various traditions that describe Him,  He has suffered injury and indigna-
tion, and He appears to be limited in  His movement and His appearances.  In
all the spells which address Him or describe Him, two things are apparent:  (a)
He  can  be  called,  and  (b)  He  cannot  manifest without being  called.  Take,  for
example, the Safnadula tradition, which crossed from India into Islamic texts.
King Safnadula has a dream in which Lord Sani appears to him, and instructs

106

him in how to perform the ceremony that will summon  Sani visibly from  His
idol.  If Sani could manifest without the need for the ceremony, would He not
do so? Second, consider the  pg m  "Salt Mill of Cronos” spell, which calls Cronos
to  appear  and  serve  as  an  oracle.  The  text  makes  very clear  that  Cronos  will
appear  in  chains,  and  that  He  will  harm  the  magician  unless  the  magician
is  protected by certain  phylacteries  and  protective  charms.  Nevertheless,  He
can  be  banished when  the  magician  has  finished the  operation.  Third,  note
that the  idol of Saturn was actually restrained by cords  (symbolizing chains),
which were removed only for the Saturnalia period. Fourth, Zuhal's name liter-
ally means The alien, the furthest away,' and His incantation makes clear that
He  is  distant from the  Earth,  unlike the  other planets which are  'close.'  In  all
of these  cases,  there  is  a definite  sense that the  Saturnine  deity,  unlike  other
deities, is not present on Earth. True, His 'star' or planetary body is feared and
considered able to strike from afar, but that is not the same thing as being able
to manifest as He might otherwise wish.

Where,  then,  is  Saturn? We might well consider the  strange  symbol of the
Black Cube, which has been discussed above. For the initiated reader, the cube
or obelisk represents the spiritual dimension to which Saturn is banished, the
spiritual  prison  to which  the  deity is  confined.  It  is  square  or  cubic,  because
this is the simplest building known to humanity, and so it represents the jail or
cell which holds the fallen king. Of course, the Black Cube is not a literal room
in which the deity is trapped; it represents a spiritual plane, a shadow-universe
which  serves  as  the  Saturnine  deity's  prison.  The  ritual  act  of setting  up  the
Black Cube as Saturn's idol, and calling the deity forth from the idol, is symbolic
of releasing Saturn from His prison. The reverence and devotion shown to the
Black Cube (e.g. the Kaaba) is symbolic of respect being shown to the lord who
is imprisoned.28 This being the case, it is reasonable to consider any conspicu-
ous occurrence of the Black Cube (in advertising, in promotion, as a corporate
symbol) as potentially symbolic of Saturn. As this text has attempted to stress,

28

It  will  be  obvious  to  the  reader  that  this  aspect  o f  Saturn/Cronos  was  understood  by

horror author Clive Barker, who mixes the motifs o f the box and chains in his nightmarish

“Hellraiser” series.

107

the cult o f the imprisoned, secretive god is not a dead cult (especially in India).
Rather,  it is a living movement that has adapted and continued in plain sight.

Sovereign ty
One  o f the  fundamental  traits  o f many  religious  systems  is  the  idea  that  the
cosmos possesses an aspect o f sovereignty. That is to say that within the cosmos,
and perhaps on different scales within the cosmos, there is an actual principle
o f law o f sovereignty, just as time and gravity are also laws.  Sovereignty can be
understood as the cosmic claim to rule legitimately. It is very clear that in many
myths,  there  are  different  divine  races  that  battle  to  control the  world  or the
heavens -  that is an example o f the cosmic battle for sovereignty. Those entities
that are usually worshipped by religions have taken possession o f the principle
o f sovereignty, and those monstrous and frightening entities that wish to take
it away are thought o f as demons.  Sometimes,  it is the monsters that have the
sovereignty, as in the case o f the Aztec Tezcatlipoca, or sometimes sovereignty
can be  granted temporarily,  as  in the  Saturnalia/Cronia festivals.  Sovereignty
can also be lost, as is demonstrated briefly during the Easter vigil.

The Saturnine deity is remembered as a sovereign, but He is not the current
sovereign  o f the  cosmos.  He  is  a  displaced and defeated  ruler,  and  rules  now
over the  prison-realm to which  He  is  confined.  Nevertheless,  primordial enti­
ties are immortal, and Saturn especially is said to personify the process o f time.
I f  the Saturnine deity is understood as an actual chained god, it is reasonable to
assume that the deity wishes to be free,  and that there  are certain parties that
would very much like to arrange the freedom or escape o f this  particular enti-
ty.  One  might wonder what Virgil  intended when  he wrote  Magnus ab  integro
saedorum  nascitur ordo,  iam  redit et Virgo,  redeunt Saturnia regna  (The  new world
order is born, and now justice returns, Saturn's reign restored). O f course, this
return to power would not go uncontested.  In most mythologies,  political and
social instability is said to reflect the chaos o f the divine order. The gods do not
reign unchallenged -  they too must face the monsters and demons o f the spirit
world.  I f  one  accepts  that  there  are  (or  may  be)  spiritual  or  planetary  forces
and intelligences that are behind the current and historical clashes o f civiliza-
tions,  then  it  is  not  a  far  stretch  to  imagine  that  these  'deities'  (by whatever

108

name)  have their own agendas.  Deities,  according to many traditions, tend to
be orderly and stabilizing cosmic entities. Yet deities also appear to be jealous
and territorial,  and resist the coming of new cultures  and religions  into their
established territories.  Such cosmic deities  are  also very likely to be hostile to
forces  from beyond the  cosmos -  that is,  Chaos. This  means that consciously
choosing to align with Saturn -  by whatever name -  is likely to cause spiritual
and social turmoil around the magician who does so.

The Saturnine  Path

The  choice  to  enter  the  current  of the  Saturnine  deity  should  be  consid-

ered carefully.  Every text  from  antiquity  and the  middle  ages,  no  matter
what  the  culture,  carries  warnings  about  dealing with  the  Lord  of the  Black
Cube.  That is  not an  accident,  and it  is  not coincidence.  The  Saturnine  deity
is  dangerous  and  capricious.  If tradition  is  accepted,  deliberately  attracting
His  attention  without  making  the  proper  offerings  and  showing  the  proper
respect is  an  open  invitation to  injury,  sickness,  and death.  If it were  not the
case, it is unlikely that there would be repeated authors and entire stories that
serve as warnings away from the cult of the black god.

Nevertheless, there is definitely a Saturnine current, a system of praxis that
leads to the darker gnosis and insights that flow from this deity. The very same
texts that warn people away from Saturn also provide instructions on how one
can contact Saturn. None of them provide explicit instructions in how to enter
the  current,  beyond  attempting  the  various  operations  to  invoke  (or  evoke)
Saturn.  Even  the  Hindu  story  of king  Safnadula  is  curiously  devoid  of any
priests or brahmins -  the "dark man” (clearly Saturn himself)  simply instructs
the king on the details of the puja, which the king carries out.

Beware -  the god of the Black Cube is a potentially dangerous god to engage
with, but deliberately choosing to take up His cause is tantamount to declaring

109

war on the spiritual powers that have imprisoned or exiled Him. Nor is Saturn
to be thought a protector deity, because He is  Himself already a marginalized
power. In other words, the Saturnine path, if we can speak of it in such a way,
cannot  be  a  path  of ease,  because  it  is  the  deliberate  rejection  of the  ruling
cosmic  order.  Nevertheless,  the  Saturnine  cause  it  not  hopeless,  not  by  any
stretch. The Aztecs thought highly enough of the  Saturnine  deity to enshrine
him  as  chief of the  gods,  and  both  Indian  tradition  and Vodou  continue  to
revere  Sani  and Samedi;  the  Romans  and Greeks  carried out annual festivals
to  placate  Saturn  and Cronos.  Ibn Wahshiyya warns his  reader that all suffer
when  Zuhal's  star  crosses  their  path.  Very  few  traditions  even  imagine  that
he could be killed, for who could slay Time, or Chaos? No, the  Saturnine deity
was feared,  and being feared, was  placated. This  is likely because the cultures
that knew  Him  anticipated the  possibility of His  ascent to  dominance.  If the
gods themselves can be overthrown, then it could well be that Jupiter or Surya
would be supplanted by the maimed god, and that would be a very dark day for
those who had not shown Him the proper respect. The Saturnine cause might
be thought something of a dark horse,  but that dark horse is  definitely in the
race.

Saturn, in fact, appears not only to have an established modern cult in India
and also  Haiti,  but many theorists  suggest that Saturn's  Roman  cult survives
today,  hidden  by  operating  boldly.  A  contemporary  (2016)  Google  search  on
such terms as "cult + Saturn" displays a large number of websites, videos, even
books on the "Saturn Conspiracy," "Saturn Death Cult," or other related move-
ments. Such links connect Saturn with the occult, ritual murders, government
conspiracy, even alien abductions. While the internet must be used judicious-
ly,  it becomes  clear,  however,  that many people  are  convinced that there  is  a
real  Saturnine  cult that holds  considerable  influence  in  international  affairs,
and that its general orientation is very sinister in nature. One might be easily
tempted to dismiss this as wild conspiracy theory, which  it may well be. Thar
said, having reviewed the scholarly traditions on Saturn, it is difficult to think
that  such  a  movement  would  run  contrary  to  the  character  of the  deity  as
portrayed  by  the  ancient  cultures.  Given  Saturn's  widespread  international
cult,  He  makes  a very convenient  subject  for  a  dark  deity figure  poised for  a

110

cultural and political  return  to  power.  The  associations with the  Kaaba espe-
cially turn even Islam into a potential extension of the Saturnine current.

It is also good to note that in terms of esoteric traditions, Saturn continued
to have a particular appeal for magicians not only in India and the Caribbean,
but also  in  continental  Europe.  For example,  the  early twentieth  century saw
the  rise  of a  German  thelemic  society  by  the  name  Fratemitas  Saturni  (the
Brotherhood  of  Saturn).  This  particular  lodge  continues  to  operate  today,
and has received some academic attention.29 It is believed that the 'Saturnine'
nature of the lodge is rather more one of essence than direct attachment to the
deity itself.

F raternias  S aturni  S ymbol

The Order of Nine Angles  (ona),  a very antinomian  Hermetic tradition which
formed in late twentieth century England, also made use of Saturn as an “acau-
sal” symbol. They associated the planet with dark forces  and suggested that a
“stargate” could be  found near to  Saturn  itself. The  order also connects  some
their more important spiritual entities to the planet. The  ona and Fraternitas
Saturni  are  but  two  examples  of recent  esoteric  currents  which  recognize
Saturn,  at  least tacitly,  as  symbolic  of some  dark  spiritual  energy  (or  gnosis)

that their tradition is thought to embody.  Both of these lodges  serve as exam-
ples of ways in which the  Saturnine current has diversified and adapted itself
to survive in recent years.

What, then, are the distinctive features of the genuine Saturnine path?
The contemporary Saturnine  path,  as this work defines  it,  is based largely
on the Saturnine traditions of antiquity. It acknowledges that Saturn (by what-
ever name)  is a planetary intelligence,  a deity that is connected to the cosmos
but originating in the black primordial Chaos that predates creation. The path
accepts that being hostile to the other powers o f the cosmos, this deity sets its
will against theirs,  for which  reason  it has been  maimed and exiled,  chained
to rule over some black dimension symbolized by its planet, Tartarus, and also
the Black Cube. As evidenced by the many mythologies in which the Saturnine
deity appears,  Saturn  seeks  and  accepts  the  service  of those  parties  who  are
willing to pledge themselves to His cause. While the deity may be locked away,
through  human  agency  and  the  correct  operations,  His  energy  and  essence
(gnosis)  can  flow  back  into  this  realm,  resulting  in  the  sorts  of conditions
which  facilitate  his  more  constant  manifestation.  The  Regna  Saturnia,  the
Saturnine  regime,  is  not a theoretical political model -  it is  an  actual state  of
political  and  social  harmony  achieved  when  humanity  relinquishes  its  own
selfish ambitions and desires,  putting aside anthrocentrism and egoism,  and
embraces the  sovereignty of the  Chaos. This  has  been  seen before  during the
Aztec empire, and also in the early days of the pre-Republic Rome. These were
genuine Saturnine kingdoms on earth, and appeared to have thrived for centu-
ries, before other spiritual powers supplanted them.

Already,  we  have  read  much  of the  virtues  and  powers  of the  black  god.
The  Saturnine deity is not a deity of brute force,  but of subtlety and cunning.
His  revolution  will  not  be  one  carried  out through  force  of arms,  but  rather
through the  spiritual planes,  as well as  through the  quiet corridors  of power.
Saturn is the god of mystery, intrigue, stealth, secrets, and malice. A Saturnine
kingdom today could,  for  example,  manifest  as  a  powerful  state where  there
are  cameras  in  every room,  watchers  on  every street,  and where  people  have
gladly surrendered their civil liberties  and dignity in exchange  for safety and
security. Put this way, it does not seem so farfetched. It could equally manifest

112

as complete and utter anarchy, with the dissolution of the civil powers,  and a
return to tribal or feudal living. This too can be seen today in the Near East. A
Saturnine kingdom does not necessarily need to have open temples to Saturn
-  they would likely as not be hidden, kept secret and open only to those initiates
of the  Saturnine  fraternity.  People who work  towards  any of these  extremes
are equally good examples of Saturnine acolytes.

A person might be drawn towards the Saturnine cult because:

■   They feel an innate connection to the Black Cube.
■   They seek a spiritual tradition that is largely self-initiating but

historical.

■   They suffer from depression or illness, and want to work with it

instead of against it.

■   They are curious about the hidden world around them, and want to

work with a deity that gives the gift of revelation.

■   They have been wronged, hurt, maimed, and they want to work with

a deity who resonates with those traits.

■   They feel marginalized and liminal.
■   They are criminals or wish to involve themselves in illegal activities,

and feel the need for spiritual patronage.

What boons does the Saturnine deity give to His acolytes? First, initiation into
the current of the Black Cube brings gnosis, the mystical knowledge that flows
from the deity. Second, initiates of the current are able to draw on the power of
the Black Cube and its emanations, in order to work Saturnine magic.

Saturnine  Gnosis
Soon after experiencing initiation, the Saturnine initiate begins to experience
the  quiet,  subtle  flow  of insights  and whispers  which  trickle  from  the  Black
Cube. The black gnosis of this deity is a mixed blessing.  Indeed,  as the patron
of secrets,  intrigue,  and hidden  things,  Saturn  allows  one  to  perceive  truths
about oneself, one's peers,  and into complex situations.  Saturn is a granter of
wisdom  and  insight,  and  so  the  acolyte  who  bears  the  black  gnosis  becomes

113

aware  of social  and  mystical  influences  in  his  community  and  surroundings
that  may  not  have  been  obvious  earlier.  Workplace  tensions  are  suddenly
more evident, and the causes for such tensions become transparent. The black
gnosis can also make one  aware of spiritual energies  and entities which were
previously invisible to the acolyte. The devotee finds that his instincts become
sharper,  and while he is not more charismatic exactly, he is better able to deal
with his peers and superiors by virtue of understanding more clearly the agen-
das  and  hidden  aims  of those  parties.  The  unspoken  conversations  become
audible, and so career advancement becomes easier to chart and navigate. The
acolyte  becomes  especially  aware  of harmful  energies,  whether  mundane  or
supernatural,  and being wary,  is better able to defend himself from whatever
harm. The Saturnine initiate also finds that his esoteric skills improve in some
areas: divinations and malefica become much easier,  as does magic related to
the  dead.  Finally,  the  black  gnosis  of Saturn  is  said  to  bring  some  degree  of
good fortune, but more importantly, to help one to mitigate bad fortune of any
kind.

There  is  a  downside  to  bearing  the  Saturnine  gnosis,  and  the  reader  has
likely anticipated it from the first chapter. The black gnosis is incredibly heavy
(tamasic) in terms of its resonance, and it carries with it the essence of the cold,
grim  deity.  Saturn  is  an  evil planet,  and  His  gnosis  is  said by the  ancients  to
bring  sorrow,  depression,  resentment,  and  suspicion.  The  Saturnine  acolyte
may be successful at work, but friends might begin to look suspect. The flaws
in  one's  romantic  partner  are  suddenly  more  sharply visible,  as  though  the
devotee is seeing them truly for the first time. Saturn is a maimed deity, and so
His  gnosis  can  prove  difficult for the  constitution of the  bearer -  old injuries
can  flare  up,  or  fatigue  and  malaise  can  become  chronic  problems.  Through
black gnosis,  one might advance rapidly at work,  but may ruin  friendships  in
the  process.  Initiates  might  find that wealth  is  easy to  come  by,  but become
miserly, and hurt friends and loved ones through a new selfishness. The acolyte
finally might swerve between a carnivalesque disregard for rules, or if in a posi-
tion of power, turn into something of a cruel dictator.  He must be careful that
in  cultivating  a  Saturnine  resonance  he  does  not  destroy all  the  good things
that he has attracted to himself.

114

This being said, tradition shows that the negative aspects of the black gnosis
can be mitigated through devotion. Section Three of this work will relate some
of the simple and sustainable practices that an acolyte can undertake in order
to stave off the worst effects of Saturnine resonance.

Saturnine  Mag ic
It is clear from current living tradition and historical record that the Saturnine
deity is  considered a patron of sorcery and other secret arts like espionage or
poisoning.  It is evident from all records that Saturn is not a benevolent deity,
and  very  few  people  have  turned  to  Him  for  help  in  light-hearted  matters.
Saturn is not a classical deity of healing,  nor of charisma, or other solar func-
tions. Spells that invoke him in the medieval tradition are of two kinds: to hurt
someone,  or  else  to  contact  the  dead.  These  are  both  very valid  examples  of
Saturnine  magical  function.  Nevertheless,  the  wider  classical  tradition,  as
well as modern living traditions, are somewhat more ambitious on His behalf.
While  Saturn  is  not a god of healing per se,  He can be  called upon to  remove
sickness. He is a god of restraint, and so His power could effect the halting (or
slowing) of such diseases as cancer or Alzheimer's.

Although  exiled and shunned by the  other  gods,  one  of Saturn's virtues  is
a certain  degree of influence and power over the other deities.  In  a sense,  He
is  able  to  usurp  their  own  virtues  for  His  ends.  For  this  reason,  the  Islamic
and  Indian  cults  both  state  that when  a  particular  planet  fails  to  fulfill your
request,  it is possible to then take that request to  Saturn.  On the surface,  this
sounds  marvelous,  as  if Saturn  is  a  catch-all  deity.  But  that would  be  a  bad
understanding of the tradition, because Saturn's radiance warps the power of
the  other  planets. An  example  here  may be  useful:  let us  say that a merchant
requires capital for an urgent business opportunity. They appeal to the Sun or
Mercury, but these operations fail. In desperation, and with time running out,
the  magician  presents  the  request to  Saturn.  A day later,  the  magician  finds
out that a relative has died and left him some inheritance. Or another example:
an  acolyte  is  in  love with  a colleague  at work.  He  or  she  attempts  a Venusian
operation, which  does  not succeed.  They then  present the  request to  Saturn.
The  operation  succeeds,  and  the  co-worker  is  smitten.  However,  the  acolyte

115

discovers that the coworker has emotional issues which have inexplicably been
aggravated,  and soon the  acolyte wishes  that he  had never done the working
in the first place.

The  point  here  is  not  to  discourage  people  from  attempting  Saturnine
magic, but to illustrate that one needs to be cautious in using Saturnine power
as a 'big stick.' If it were not the case, then the warnings to this effect would not
be repeated in the various traditions.

Here  follows  a final example, which is  a true  story known to the author. A
young magician in university began to cultivate Saturnine devotion and decid-
ed to experiment with developing 'second sight.' With the understanding that
Saturn was a god of veiling and unveiling, the magician performed a Saturnine
operation to open the third eye and perceive the spirit world more clearly. The
ritual had no immediate effects, but then the magician began to perceive near-
by  spirits  at  night,  and  often  when  it was  time  for  sleep.  Unfortunately,  the
continued Saturnine work tended to attract chthonic and malevolent entities,
which would appear suddenly and then fade from view after several moments.
The  condition  never went  away,  leaving the  magician with  exhausting bouts
of insomnia.

Blood  for  the  Reaper
One  of the  universal  aspects  of the  historical  and  modern  cult  of the  Black
Cube  is  the  sacrifice  of living  beings,  animal  and  human.  In  ancient  times,
the authors of the  Saturnine texts wrote that black animals are to be  given to
Saturn, which is an indication of His chthonic nature. Black animals were only
ever  given  to  underworld  gods  or  spirits,  such  as  Pluto,  Hecate,  or Yama,  so
this  says  much  about the  Saturnine  deity as  a  death  god. We  know  also  that
the  North African cult, which worshipped Saturn as 'Baal  Haamon,' is  said to
have  practiced human  sacrifice  by  immolation,  where  the  Romans  practiced
it through the gladiatorial games, and Macrobius states that it was performed
through  the  ritual  slaughter  of criminals  prior  to  the  rise  of the  Republic.
Ancient cultures  such  as the Vikings  and Celts  are  famous  for their practices
of animal and human sacrifice, and even the weekly Christian communion (or
Eucharist)  is  very  possibly  a  Romanized  sacrificial  rite  based  on  the  Saturn

116

cult,  where  wine  is  substituted  for  blood,  just  as  it was  done  in  funeral  rites
during the Imperial period. On a similar note, when Tezcatlipoca was the chief
deity of the Aztec empire, human hearts were cut out and offered to him on a
daily basis.

This is all to show that Saturn is the Reaper, and His cult requires the death
or at least blood o f living beings. Sacrifice of animals continues today, in India
and in the Carribean, where  Lord Sani and Baron Samedi respectively receive
the blood of animals as part of the modern Saturnine cult.

Blood is power, and blood makes noise in the spirit world.30 Blood sacrifice
has been part of the worship of most of the world's ancient religious traditions.
In  fact,  Hinduism  (in  part)  and  Islam  maintain  blood  sacrifice  as  an  obliga-
tory  annual  practice.  All  traditional  African  and  afro-centric  religions  like
Candomblé  and Vodou  practice  animal  sacrifice.  Even  in  the  Hajj,  the  great
pilgrimage which  survives  from  pre-Islamic  times,  an  animal  is  sacrificed to
the  Lord of the  Black Cube -  understood today as Allah,  but known  in  earlier
times as Dahr, the Arabian god of time. In other words, the Muslim ritual today
of Eid el Kbir is a modern Islamic rite based on an ancient Saturnine ritual.

The  modern  occultist's  aversion  to  blood  is  a  strange  thing,  and  is  diffi-
cult  to  trace  back  past  the  early  twentieth  century.  The  most  likely  explana-
tion is that as the Christian West abandoned sacrifice in the medieval period,
sacrifice  was  seen  as  a  'barbarian'  practice,  only  performed  in  the  occiden-
tal colonial lands  like Africa  and  India.  Sacrifice was  not  seen  as  a 'white'  or
'civilized'  practice.  Since  occultism  as  it  is  practiced  today  is  predominantly
Europeanized,  the  ancient  traditions  were  revived  half-heartedly.  Sacrifice,
which is  evident in the texts,  had to be  stripped out,  and so many contempo-
rary occultists attempt to dismiss it as 'symbolic,' though they oddly maintain
that the  gods  themselves  are  real.  This  has  led to  systems  of the  occult today
which claim legitimacy based on their knowledge of tradition, while they para-
doxically abstain from  (or worse,  ridicule)  the practice of blood sacrifice. This

30  For important insights into the  nature of sacrifice  and the  relationship of blood and soul,
I  once  again  refer the  reader to the  gnosis  o f David Beth  and also to the work o f Ludwig

Klages. See for example:  C hthonic Gnosis.  L u dw ig  Klages and  his  Quest fo r  the  Pandaem onic A ll.

117

attitude of ridiculing the practice of sacrifice stems entirely from the Catholic
and  Protestant  Missionary  movement,  and  it  is  unfortunate  that  modern
occultists have maintained these colonial Christian ideas  in their occult prac-
tices. There is no room for the 'respectable colonial' occultist in the Saturnine
movement.

If someone wishes  to  approach the  Saturnine  deity,  they should be  aware
that this  is  not a bloodless cult.  Saturn  expects  and demands  blood -  there  is

S aturn,  E ngraving  by Jacob  M atham after H endrik G oltzius

118

no documented account of any genuinely Saturnine cult without the sacrifice
of life. Saturn is an aspect of the divine Chaos, which predates life as we usually
understand it, and will eventually consume it all. Sacrifice is a way of returning
life to Saturn, and through Him, to Chaos. Blood sacrifice is symbolic (of devo-
tion and faith), but it is also a very real magical act.

That said,  if someone feels a strong aversion to offering the life of another
being,  this  need not be  a barrier  per  se  to  the  Saturnine  cult.  Many devotees
in  India  today  do  not  offer  blood  directly  (though  the  temples  may),  and  so
there  is  precedent  for  approaching  Saturn without  the  personal  shedding  of
blood. In this case, the acolyte is advised to follow the Roman custom of offer-
ing a small portion of their own blood, mixed with a larger portion of red wine.
However, in the view of the author such a 'sanitized' approach also reduces the
effect and power of the ritual and consequently the response and reverse flow
of power to the initiate.

Section  Three

Saturnine P ractice

Overview

The  first two  sections  of this  book have  dealt with the  Saturnine  cult on  a

largely theoretical level. The  author hopes  sincerely that even a non-prac-
ticing  reader  might  derive  some  benefit  from  having  studied those  sections,
even  if only academic.  However,  this  final chapter is dedicated to those  read-
ers  who  are  interested  in  actually  self-initiating,  and  then  developing  the
Saturnine  cultus  on  their  own.  The  chapter outlines  several of the  spells  and
practices discussed earlier in the book, as well as devotional actions which are
traditionally very pleasing to Saturn.

A  W ord  Of  Caution
It  seems  necessary  to  include  a  word  of caution.  Whatever  the  views  of the
reader,  it  has  been  the  conviction  of entire  cultures  for  thousands  of years
that  Saturn  is  a  dangerous  deity with  which  to  work.  His  influence,  even  to
His  friends and devotees,  can cause harm and hardship.  If someone has read
this study and feels generally resonating with the character of the Black Cube,
then the practices here will genuinely help in building a relationship with the
deity.  If, on the other hand, one believes that deities are merely archetypes or
symbols  given  meaning  only through  culture,  then  the  author would  recom-
mend the reader to seek out another grimoire with which to experiment. The
modern  cult  of self-deification  or  self-aggrandizement  is  incompatible  with

123

the  Saturnine  cult.  Tradition  makes  clear  that  Saturn  requires  His  students
and acolytes to begin from a position of humility,  even abasement.  Partaking
in the cult of Saturn requires letting go of the ego, because only when the ego
is  put aside will  Saturn  deign to  share his black gnosis.  Finally,  Saturn  is  not
a  symbol or  archetype.  The  author holds  that  Saturn  is  entirely real,  and  His
power  is  not ever  invoked lightly.  If one wishes  to begin  these  practices,  it  is
good to bear in mind that this deity, in every tradition, is as vindictive as He is
powerful. With this  said,  if having read this  far you feel the urge to celebrate
the Saturnine mysteries, this third chapter is especially for you.

The  Cult  Of  The  Black Cube
There  are  two  primary  sections  here:  “Saturnine  Devotion,”  and  “Saturnine
Magic.” Devotion consists of those traditional practices that are associated with
Saturn,  and  are  intended  and recommended to  please  the  entity that  dwells
in  the  Black Cube.  Saturnine  magic  consists  of those  rituals  and ceremonies
that are found in various  ancient and medieval texts,  as well as their particu-
lars, such as recommended incense, fumigations, colors, and other ceremonial
details.

This book, unlike the ancient grimoires that it draws from, aims to present
and apprehend the  Saturnine deity as  a force that is beyond any one  culture.
Several cultures have developed their own unique cultus and practices around
the  god of the  Black Cube, and as we have  seen, there  is  considerable overlap
in how those practices relate to each other. Nevertheless, this grimoire belongs
to  the  twenty-first  century,  and  it  is  written  in  English  for  a  contemporary
audience. Thus, there  is  something of a fine line to be walked between  main-
taining tradition as much as possible, while adapting some details as needed.
We  are  not the  first to do  so -  in  past centuries,  for example,  the  ingredients
of the  fumigation to  summon  Saturn  in Arabic were  altered for  Spanish  and
Latin. That is  not a question or error of translation -  it was  done because the
magicians involved in the cultus made the necessary adaptation based on the
plants  and  minerals  indigenous  to  Spain,  which  were  likely  not  indigenous
to Harran.  Esoteric currents can adapt and still be traditional,  as long as they
remain faithful to the spirit of the tradition, rather than its trappings. In other

124

words, this grimoire will present the devotional practices and ceremonies not
as if they belong to four or five separate deities, but as practices that stem from
different regional parts of a single cult. The entire premise of this work is that
the Saturnine deity is one entity that manifests in different times and places,
but the  fundamental essence  of the  deity is  the  same,  and so the  practices  of
veneration and supplication are equally valid, wherever and whenever.

Saturnine Devotion: Establishing A Shrine

The first step necessary to cultivate the devotion to Saturn is a sacred space

in  which  one  can  properly  revere  the  deity,  as  well  as  perform  rites  and
ceremonies.  This  does  not  need to  be  a  large  space,  but  it  should  be  a  dedi-
cated area of your home which will not be used for other purposes. In this area,
you should assemble a shrine or altar space. As  Saturn is a god of secrets and
mysteries, the shrine does not need to be obvious to others. It is very appropri-
ate for it to be hidden in plain sight, or to be in an area that is closed off to other
people.  It  is  best  if it  can  be  placed away from  high-traffic  areas,  or where  it
might be disturbed by children or pets.

There is considerable flexibility in how you construct the shrine, and it need
not be especially ornate -  in fact, tradition states that Saturn prefers rough and
dark objects, so a dark wooden table or cement blocks would in fact be prefer-
able to a golden altar. Shrines can be elaborate, but do not need to be. Saturn is
a deity of the low, as well as the high.

A basic shrine should contain the following items:

■   Saturnine  idol:  According  to  tradition,  the  most  common  idol  of
Saturn is a black stone cube or obelisk, symbolic of the prison world ruled
by the dark god. As there are many aspects and attributes of Saturn, the

125

acolyte should feel free to choose whichever cultural mask of the god he
best identifies with. The Roman Saturn is as valid as Baron Samedi, for
example, as both exemplify very real aspects of the deity. It is important
to remember here that the true deity is the one behind the many various
names.

■  Altar cloths: The  shrine  should be draped in  dark colors,  like black,
blue,  or  very  dark  grey.  The  cloth  should  be  made  from  wool  if at  all
possible.

■  Incense: The Saturnine deity accepts a wide range of incense mixes,
some  of which  are  described below.  Easily  available  examples  include
aloe, as well as anything bitter-scented.

■  Oil: Oil is one of the most common offerings to the Saturnine deity.
Sesame oil and olive oil are the two preferred by the dark god.

■  Offering bowl: From time to time, it is advisable to make liquid offer-
ings to the Saturnine deity, or to burn small offerings on the shrine.  In
this case, an offering bowl can greatly simplify the process.

■  Candles: These should be black or blue, and can be lit (or not) during
the days of the week, and during rites. It is traditional for the candles to
be allowed to burn all throughout the day on Saturday.

These items are suggested by tradition, but optional based on availability:

■  Secondary idols:  While  it  is  good  to  have  a  central  deity  installed,
there  can  be  definite  benefits  to  having  other  Saturnine  images  or
symbols  on  the  table.  This  is  in  keeping  with  the  medieval  cultus  of
Saturn,  especially  in  Islamic  tradition,  which  deliberately  borrowed
from the other Saturnine cults. The secondary idols might also be used
for the Saturnine consort, such as Mater Lua, depending on the inclina-
tion of the acolyte.

126

■   Cutting tool: An iron (or steel) knife, spike, or sickle is a useful imple-
ment, as some of the Saturnine rituals require bloodshed, or the use of a
sharp object to inscribe texts on ritual talismans.

■   Chains:  Saturn  is  a chained deity,  and so the  presence  of chains  on
the shrine is a very effective tool for resonance. Chains should be iron or
steel, and can be worn by the devotee as a symbol of Saturn's imprison-
ment.

■   Iron jewelry: Rings, bracelets, and other jewelry of iron can be placed
on the shrine as gifts to Saturn. A month after they have been presented,
they can be 'borrowed' from the shrine, and worn as protective charms.

■   Black mirror:  A  dark  mirror,  a  bowl  of black  fluid,  or  an  obsidian
sphere  are  each  good examples  of the black mirror principle. The deity
may use this to reveal mysteries,  and it can be employed as an effective
communion tool.

With the shrine established in the home or workplace, it is good to offer respects
daily to the idol of the deity. In a sense, once the shrine has been set up and the
image of the deity installed, it should be treated as a living thing. Lengthy devo-
tional rituals are not required on a daily basis, though there is no objection to
it.  It  is  sufficient  to  greet  the  shrine  respectfully  once  a  day,  offering  what-
ever gesture feels culturally appropriate -  some may bow, or kneel, or cover the
heart with the hands -  and to speak in a polite, respectful tone. It is also recom-
mended to keep the shrine clean and clear of all dust and debris. Never under
any circumstances  allow the  shrine to be  used for any other  purpose,  and do
not allow it to become neglected.

Be assured that over time, the energy of the dark god will slowly build with-
in  the  shrine.  Saturn's  power  is  slow  and  cold,  and  so  a  new  acolyte  should
not expect the shrine room to become suddenly filled with the Saturnine reso-
nance.  It is more likely to take place over weeks and months of spiritual feed-
ing.  Nevertheless,  once that power begins  to take  root within the  shrine,  it is

127

very hard  to  dislodge,  and  it  becomes  very  pervasive.  The  aura  of Saturnine
shrines, not surprisingly, tends to be somewhat grave, reserved, and even cold.
They can and will, however, manifest a certain level of chaos and even gallows
humor, especially if Baron Samedi is the chief Saturnine aspect propitiated.

Daily  Offerings  to  the  Shrine
In  addition to  greeting the  shrine  daily,  it is  good to  make  small offerings to
the shrine in order to show respect to the god. There is considerable flexibility
in what should be offered, but tradition indicates that a small amount of olive
oil, sugar, or sesame seeds can be used. These can be deposited in the bowl, and
after a day can be offered to someone in need (if feasible), or else given directly
to the earth. It is not recommended to eat from Saturn's table directly, but His
offerings can be given to others as a gift. The oil and sugar, for example, can be
baked into a cake and gifted to someone who has suffered ill fortune. Under no
circumstances  should offerings  be thrown  out with  garbage.  In the  case  that
oil is offered, a dab of the oil can be placed on the idol -  this is one of the most
common traditional practices of Saturnine devotion.

Establishing  the  Magical  Link
As we said before, to forge an intimate link with the Saturnine deity, no exter-
nal  initiation  or  esoteric  transmission  is  necessary  (although,  depending  on
the  goals  of the  devotee this  may be  required later,  see  my comments  on the
role  of the  teacher in  a previous  chapter).  In  agreement with  the  majority of
historical Saturnine texts, this grimoire simply requires adequate preparation
for ceremony and the  dedicated cultivation of devotion to  Saturn  in  order to
gain  His blessings and Gnosis. The deity alone selects to whom He will reveal
Himself.

Initiation  requires  primarily  the  resolve  (at  some  level)  to  take  up  the
Saturnine  cause,  and  then  to  begin  the  devotional  practices,  first  by  the
construction of a sacred space (the shrine). If Saturn accepts the spiritual devo-
tion and respect being shown, the acolyte will begin to feel the transmission of
gnosis.  It  is  not uncommon  to  experience  dreams  or visions  of Saturn,  or to
dream of symbols, vivid colors, objects (like the Black Cube), or animals associ-

128

ated with Saturn, or even to dream about places and characters associated with
the Saturnine current. The oncoming of Saturnine gnosis can be unpleasant -
tradition states that Saturn often gives the bad before the good. As an example,
a potential acolyte with a normally positive state of mind could become cyni-
cal and depressed in a relatively short period of time.  If the initiate  somehow
retains a level of clinical objectivity during the early days of Saturnine practice,
this is a very good thing. One effective technique is the keeping of a journal, to
keep  track of one's  experiences,  insights,  and  emotional  states  following the
first initiatic steps on the Saturnine path.

However, if after several months there is no sense of connection to Saturn,
and no perceptible change in insight,  ability, or state of mind,  it may be good
for acolytes to assess their practice. It may be that they have approached Saturn
without sincerity or with hesitation,  in which case their devotion  may not be
producing sufficiently strong psychic noise to reach the deity. Saturn is said to
be 'distant' for a reason, and He is not thought to be as accessible as other more
cosmic deities like the solar or lunar gods. Alternately, the prospective initiate
may simply not be on the same spiritual frequency as Saturn, and so this may
not be the best current for him. While we  do not say that he  should abandon
the  Saturnine practices altogether, he may wish to explore other esoteric and
gnostic schools of practice. That is not at all an indication of failure, but rather
merely suggestive that the natural energies of the person are not conducive to
Saturn's energy, or possibly that it is not the right time in that person's life for
Saturn  to  appear.  If a  person  has  a  strong Jupiterian  or  Solar  resonance,  for
example,  he  may not be  suited  for  Saturnine work.  Some  teachers  have  also
suggested that  during  the  adolescent  and  early adult years  it  may be  harder
to practice the Saturnine cult, because Saturn's influence tends to favor those
who  have  reached  maturity,  especially  those  who  are  elderly  or  in  the  voca-
tional roles discussed in Section One.

All this  said,  some  people will  still wish to  perform  an  initial ceremony to
mark their first step on the  Saturnine  path,  and that is  a normal and healthy
desire.  If this is the case, the reader can make use of the rite below. This ritual
can also be used in conjunction with the establishment of a Saturnine  shrine
(also  discussed  below),  so  that  it  is  used  to  empower  the  shrine/idol,  rather

129

than the acolyte himself. This particular variance of practice is more commonly
found in the eastern Saturnian cults  (Indian and Islamic), and is still very well
attested and respected in those regions. The ritual is detailed below on p. 141f.

Saturnine Magic

This  grimoire  is  based  on  textual  and  spiritual  traditions  that  show  hard

evidence  of Saturn  being  a  magical  deity,  and  a  patron  especially  of the
darker  spiritual  arts. Admittedly,  Saturnine  magic  has  rarely been  used with
positive  intentions,  unless  there  is  a  genuine  emergency.  After  reading  so
many  texts  that  discuss  Saturn  as  a  God  of sorcery,  it  would  be  reasonable
for  someone  to  think  that  taking  the  Black  Cube  as  spiritual  patron  means
having to practice magical rites. The author would like to make plain that this
is  not  at  all the  case.  One  can  feel a  resonance with  the  Saturnine  deity,  and
decide to commune and connect with that entity,  and have no desire  (or abil-
ity)  for magic.  Devotion  is  power  and brings  power.  The  Saturnine  deity will
give His black gnosis to anyone who truly seeks Him, provided that they revere
Him properly.  In  fact,  it is very accurate to  say that the  genuine  power of the
Saturnine  current  is  not tied to  individual  rites  per  se  but  is  derived  from  a
constant devotion to the  Lord of the Black Cube which triggers a gradual flow
of gnosis and empowerment.

Saturnine  Devotion:  Daily  Practices
While  Saturday is the  dominant day of the week celebrated by the  Saturnine
acolyte, one should select several daily practices which are simple and sustain-
able.  By "sustainable," we  mean  that  the  practices  should be  something  that
will not cause  exhaustion  or  frustration  in the  long term,  and so they should
not be  elaborate  in terms  of time or expense.  It is  far better to have  a simple

130

daily  routine  that  can  be  performed  in  10-15  minutes,  as  opposed  to  doing
nothing all week and then a three-hour ritual on  Saturdays alone.  Deities  are
selfish beings,  and a worshipper who ignores their deity six days out of seven
will find that they receive the same sort of attention  (if any)  from the deity. As
an  example  of this  principle,  even  though  the  Romans  ceremonially chained
up the  chief idol of Saturn for most of the year,  they never neglected the  idol.
The  Temple  of Saturn  at  Rome  maintained  a  permanent  cult  and  dedicated
priesthood,  and was  entrusted with  the  federal treasure -  this  indicates  that
Saturn  received  daily adoration  in  exchange  for  His  continued  patronage  of
the empire.  In the same way, the  Saturnine acolyte should maintain a level of
veneration that is sustainable throughout the year.  It is also good to note that
initiates from many esoteric cults often experience great zeal at the beginning,
which is commendable, but this can lead to beginning very advanced or ardu-
ous  practices,  which  eventually  lead  to  spiritual  burn-out.  There  is  nothing
wrong with  rigorous  devotion,  on  the  contrary even,  but  it  should  not  be  so
rigorous that it becomes a dreaded chore, or worse, is eventually abandoned.

It  should  be  noted  that  Saturnine  devotion  is  never  ostentatious.  While
some  esoteric  currents  do have very visible  forms  of devotion,  the  Saturnine
cult  is  predicated  on  mystery.  You  alone  should  know  that  you  are  carrying
out acts  of devotion, with the  only exception  of close  family and friends who
are  supportive  of your  activities.  Even  then,  Saturnine  devotion  is  especially
potent when it is carried out entirely in secret.

There  are  several traditional  daily devotional  practices  to  show respect to

Saturn, which can include:

PRAYER
Tradition shows that as the Saturnine deity is moved by humility, prayer is an
effective way to approach the  Lord of the  Black Cube. This  grimoire  contains
several examples of very traditional prayers, which can be memorized, or else
recited aloud from a text. Saturnine prayer is best performed quietly or silently,
and in secret. Alternately, acolytes may compose their own prayers as desired,
in whichever language -  Saturn is not an earthly being, and He has no particu-
lar attachment to any one language. Also, traditions are never static and always

131

developing, thus it is better to offer a new prayer that feels sincere, rather than
an ancient prayer that feels archaic and awkward. While some contemporary
esoteric  currents  are  scornful  about  prayer,  or  indeed deference  to  spirits  of
any order,  the  Saturnine tradition  demands  approaching  Saturn  as  a suppli-
cant, not as an equal.

CHAINS
A simple but effective devotional practice is the wearing of iron or steel chains.
These can be on the wrist or neck, or elsewhere on the body that is convenient.
Chains  symbolize  the  chains  which  Saturn  himself wears,  and  by  wearing
chains of iron (or a similar composite metal), the acolyte is making a conscious
decision to identify with the god.  If chains are not feasible or cause irritation,
the  acolyte  could  chose  to  borrow  the  Roman  concept  of using  wool  cords
instead,  in which case he will wish to use wool that has preferably been  dyed
black, blue, or dark grey.

CHAR ITY
Saturn  can  be  a  malevolent  force,  but like  any  ancient  king,  He  is  magnani-
mous.  Giving  charity  secretly  in  his  name  is  recommended  as  a  solid  tradi-
tional practice.  This  can  be  an  anonymous  donation,  in which  case  it  should
be given to a group of marginalized and disenfranchised people, to foreigners,
to the elderly, or to people suffering from chronic illness. If the donor receives
any praise or credit for the  gift,  Saturn will not accept the act as devotion.  In
some  cases  it may not be possible to  maintain complete anonymity,  in which
case the acolyte should simply strive to make the charity as quietly as possible.

M ANTRAS
The  Indian cult of Saturn has  several mantras that have proven very effective
since antiquity, and these may be found in various sources online and in print.
Mantras  are  said  to  be  especially  effective  if received  from  a  living  teacher,
but this is not always practical or possible. The best one recommended by the
author is the following: om s h a m   s h r i   s h a n a i s h c h a r a y a   n a m a h a . A devotee of the
Saturnine  cult  in  India  today would  recite  this  phrase  at  least  108  times  per

132

day, quietly or silently. While this mantra can be recited at any time of the day,
according to tradition it is most effective  at sunset,  or otherwise  right before
sunrise. As a nocturnal deity,  Saturn's mantra can be recited at night without
ill  effects.  This  particular  mantra  is  said to  have  two  primary effects:  first,  it
neutralizes or mitigates the most harmful effects of Saturn's gaze; second, it is
said to promote good fortune and earn the favor of the deity.

Sacred  Time

A s a deity with power over time, or perhaps even the personification o f time,

Saturn is associated with two calendar dates. One is the weekly day which
is named in his honor (Saturday), and the other is the annual Saturnalia festi-
val  in  December.  Both  are  considered  sacred time  for  the  Saturnine  acolyte.
These are discussed below, together with the special acts of worship which are
expected to be carried out.

SATURDAY
The  seventh  day  of the  week  is  named  for  Saturn,  not  only  in  the  Western
calendar,  but  in  Indian  calculation  of time  as  well.  This  has  been  the  case
since  ancient times,  and it is  not by accident that the very name  of the week
in English has maintained this association, despite the other days of the week
being Anglo-Saxon  in  origin.  (Sun-day,  Moon-Day,  Tiw's-Day, Woden's-Day,
etc.).  How then should Saturday be observed? The traditional response is that
Saturday,  being  special  to  Saturn,  is  the  day  on  which  some  level  of ritual
worship should take place. The ceremony need not be elaborate or lengthy, but
it is worth taking some time to respect the shrine, present new offerings,  and
ask for the continued favor and benediction of the Saturnine deity.  Saturnine
worship  on  Saturday  involves  the  performance  of ideally two  or  more  of the

133

standard  daily  practices.  In  fact,  one  could  very  reasonably  do  all  o f them,
including the offerings.

In terms o f offerings, it is good to present additional gifts to Saturn on that
day.  Saturnine offerings  are o f two kinds:  those to be burned,  and those to be
given  in  charity.  Traditional  texts  state  that  Saturn  likes  to  have  black  leath-
er,  grease,  even  carrion  burned  in  his  honor.  A  contemporary  acolyte  might
choose to cut up  an old leather item  (like  a wallet or purse)  and to burn  strips
o f it.  This  demonstrates  the  destruction  o f the  material  reality,  which  is  part
o f Saturn's  role  in the  cosmic  drama.  In terms  o f items to be  given  in  charity,
Saturn  prefers black and dark blue things,  so some  good contemporary offers
could include  molasses,  coffee,  black bean,  sesame,  olive  and  sesame  oil,  and
dark  clothes  -   all  o f which  can  be  donated to  charities,  foodbanks,  and  shel-
ters afterwards. It should be noted that these items are not presented and then
kept by the  acolyte,  as this  is  certain to attract very bad luck. After presenting
the items to the  shrine,  they should be  given the  same day to whatever shelter
or charity,  or set aside in a private place to be  given on the next Saturday. The
act o f donation is part o f the worship. It is also recommended to give money in
charity on Saturdays especially. This cash does not need to be presented to the
shrine and can be  given to the charity, or ideally to a poor person directly. The
giver must have the intention in mind,  at the time o f giving, that the donation
is a Saturnine act.

Saturday is a day o f restraint.  It is a day where the  Saturnine acolyte should
practice  some  level  o f restriction.  This  can  be  fasting,  abstaining from  smok-
ing  or  alcohol  or  the  internet  or  sunlight.  The  restriction  should  be  unique
to you,  and it  should  genuinely involve  giving up  something that you like.  By
experiencing  and  knowing  restriction,  you  are  better  able  to  understand the
principle o f chaining,  and to better identify with the  Saturnine god. Tradition
holds that metaphorically chaining yourself for Saturn's sake is pleasing to the
deity.

Finally,  if the acolyte follows the practice o f sacrifice, or intends to perform
any Saturnine  magic,  Saturday is  the  most auspicious  time  o f the week to  do
so. Within  Saturday, the  first and eighth hours immediately after  sunrise and
sunset are considered especially auspicious for any Saturnine rituals.

134

SRTUGRRUR
The great Greco-Roman festivals of the Cronia/Saturnalia have been discussed
in Section One already as a well attested practice. The Saturnalia festival takes
place  in  the  month  of December  every day,  beginning  on  17th  and  ending on
the 23rd. For the Saturnine acolyte today, the Saturnalia represents a chance to
shake free from the shackles of responsibility and social norms, and to engage
in  otherwise  chaotic  acts.  On  a  positive  note,  this  festival  coincides  with the
Christmas season  (which was intended to supplant the Saturnalia), and ironi-
cally Christmas presents a good pretext for otherwise eccentric behavior.

During  the  Saturnalia,  the  contemporary  acolyte  can  adapt  some  of the

following customs:

■   Dress: Saturnalia is a time to indulge in styles and fashions that one
might normally shun. Hair styles, clothing, colors can all be experiment-
ed with.

■   Food and Drink: During the Saturnalia festival, consider trying foods
or flavors you normally might avoid. The festival is a time for indulgence.
If possible,  see  if your  family can  have  some  of its  festive  meals  ahead
of Christmas day,  so that whatever traditional foods  (which are usually
specific to the season and therefore abnormal otherwise) can be enjoyed
together.  If you normally avoid sugary things and sweets, indulge for a
change.  Get drunk -  of course,  not to the  point of dangerous  behavior,
but so that you feel free  to be yourself.  This  is  the  time to throw off all
reasonable restraints.

■   Parties:  Throw an office 'holiday party' as  a covert Saturnalia event.
Bringing people together for wild fun is positive and good, creating the
type  of chaos that will make the workplace less of a hive  and more of a
home. Be bold -  this could be the time to express interest in that attrac-
tive single friend or co-worker. Be smart -  this is absolutely not the time
to  sexually harass  someone.  Since the larger community does  not cele-
brate Saturnalia, it is necessary to not engage in out-of-control behavior

135

that will  trouble  you throughout  the  year.  Unlike  the  days  of Imperial
Rome, there are consequences to bad behavior that will not be forgiven
after the festival ends.

■   Gifts: It is traditional to offer small gifts to friends and family. These
should not be  expensive. As  the  Christmas  season  follows  on  the  heels
of Saturnalia, this provides a pretext for gifts, if one is needed. Through
giving gifts, even humorous ones, one embodies the magnanimity of the
exiled king.

■   Chaos:  The  overall  purpose  of the  Saturnalia  festival  is  to  celebrate
the temporary release of Saturn from the prison of the  Black Cube, but
also to release His chaotic essence into the social fabric. This is a time to
celebrate freedom from the restrictions of the world, and to be free from
the shackles of the expectations and restrictions of others. Try something
new and different, a hobby, a style of music. Change your routine -  sleep
during  the  day  and work  by  night.  By behaving  in  alternate  and  alien
patterns, you are discharging the energy of chaos and uncertainty into
your own private world, which will trickle  into the larger world around
you. Above all, be the part of yourself that you are normally afraid to be.

Saturnine  Incense
There are two recommended incenses for Saturn. Both are found in The Picatrix
(Book 3.6)31 and hence are traditional recipes.

■   Take  equal parts  of opium,  styrax  (herb),  saffron,  laurel seed,  costly
wormwood,  dry wool,  bitter apple,  black cat hairs.  Grind this together,
then mix it together with black wool. Roll it into threads to form incense
sticks, which can be burned in the rites.

Or:

31  Adapted from the Ouroboros edition.

136

■   Take an equal amount of Armenian incense, juniper and the seed of
the  tar  tree  [or tar],  dates  and asparagus.  Grind them  all together  and
knead them and cook them with basil. Then roll it into incense balls, and
burn them during the rites.

Saturnine  Offerings
The  traditional  texts  all  insist  that  the  Saturnine  cult  demands  blood  offer-
ings. If the acolyte does not agree with animal sacrifice, he may choose his own
blood mixed with wine as  a substitute.  Preferable animal sacrifices  should be
dark grey or black in color, and are best if they are unblemished. The tradition-
al texts  identify Saturn's  preferred sacrifices  as  cattle,  goats,  sheep,  cats,  and
bats. Animals are to be  slaughtered as  painlessly as possible,  and the blood of
the animal is presented to the idol on the shrine via the offering bowl. Sacrifices
are almost always performed during one of the rites to summon a manifesta-
tion of Saturn.

137

Saturnine  Rituals

Self  I nitiation R ite

The  acolyte  who  wishes  to  be  initiated  into  the  Saturnine  current  should

first construct a simple  household shrine  (discussed above).  If this  is  not
possible  for  whatever  reasons  of safety  or  privacy,  then  a  small  temporary
altar should be set up, positioned in the northern part of the room, so that the
acolyte  faces  north when  standing  at the  altar.  On  the  altar  or  shrine  should
be  placed  such  items  as  incense,  blue  or black candles,  a  sharp  knife,  and an
offering bowl. The offering bowl should have a small mixture of olive oil with
charcoal or ashes, creating a black paste.

The  Rite

■   The acolyte begins the rite by generating a sincere desire to connect

with the Saturnine deity.

■   He next should bow towards the Saturnine idol/symbol on the

shrine, and then light the incense and candles.

■   He then fumigates the idol and the four directions.

■   Likewise, the knife is shown to the idol and the four directions.

141

■   The celebrant cuts his left hand (thumb or fingers), and then mixes

his blood into the black paste in the offering bowl.

■   The bloodied offering bowl is now shown to the idol.

■   The acolyte takes some of the black paste and makes a black mark

(representing Saturn) on his forehead.

■   The acolyte kneels before the altar and recites this invocation:

I call You,  dark father,  in the  name of Chaos which placed You over the
seventh  sphere.  I  call You,  who  are  given  to  cold  thoughts  and  colder
acts, You in the seventh sphere. Master and Prisoner of the  Black Cube,
some  call  You  Saturnus,  or  Keyvan,  or  Zuhal,  or  Chronos,  and  others
Sani.  I  call You by Your secret name,32 oh  Saturnine  god!  By the  inexo-
rable  name  and by these  offerings  I  give  to You,  I  ask You to  manifest
within me. Overshadow me with Your glory. Oh great Master, placed in
the highest realm, cold and dry in nature, You are noble and fair, just in
Your enmity with humanity. Oldest of the powers, first of the firstborn,
descend and dwell within me.

The  acolyte  should  seat  himself on  the  ground  and  visualize  the  Saturnine
power  descending  and  filling  him.  The  gnosis  of the  deity will  feel  cold  and
dark.  It is  good to meditate  for as  long as  possible,  focusing the  mind on the
images of Saturn which appear. This initiation ritual can be performed repeat-
edly (meaning once a month, twice a year, etc.), especially if the acolyte feels a
desire to connect with the energies of the deity.

32  The 'secret' or 'true' name mentioned in this and other rituals is either communicated orally
to  the  celebrant by his  teacher  or  has  been  gifted to  the  fortunate  initiate  directly by the
Saturnine deity.

142

The Oracle of Cronos

This  spell is  intended to summon a manifestation of Cronos to serve as an

oracle. This  ritual is  not intended to ask favors  of the dark lord,  but rath-
er to  beseech  Him to  answer  questions  about the  past,  present,  or future. As
Cronos  (Saturn)  is Lord of Time, He is one of the greatest of the oracular gods
of antiquity.  The  spell  suggests  that  the  deity  will  appear  in  a  hostile  form,
which  may be  due to the  fact that the  magician  appears  to threaten the  deity
in the original text. As the  Saturnine  acolyte would never dare to menace the
god,  the  text has been  adapted to  represent the  greater  international cult.  In
the formula to call the god, the letters 'NN' indicate that the acolyte should state
whatever their request may be.

The  Rite33
Prior  to  the  ritual,  the  initiate  should  put  on  clothing  of rough,  black  cloth.
Black wool  is  best,  if available.  The  ritual  should be  performed  at  night  in  a
place where grass grows.

First,  kindle a small ritual fire.  Into it, offer sage to the god, together with
blood, the hair of a cat, and manure. Then take two handfuls of salt, and grind
with a hand mill while saying the formula many times, until the god appears to
you. If, while you are speaking, you hear the heavy step of someone and a clat-

33  Adapted from PGM IV. 3086-3124.

143

ter of iron, the  god is coming bound with chains,  holding a sickle.  But do not
be frightened, since you are His devotee.

The formula to be spoken while you are grinding the salt is this:

'I call you, the great, holy, the one who created the whole inhabited world,
against whom the transgression was committed by your own son, whom
Helios bound with adamantine fetters lest the universe be mixed togeth-
er,  you  hermaphrodite,  father  of the  thunderbolt,  you who  hold  down
those  under  the  earth, Aie  Oi  Paidalis  Phrenoteicheido  Stygardes  Sankleon
/  Genechrona  Koirapsai  Kerideu  Thala-Mnia  Ochota Anedei;  come,  master,
god, and tell me by necessity concerning the nn matter, for I am the one
who revolted with you against Coelus, Paidolis Mainolis Mainolieus.’

And the formula which soothes his wrath is:

‘Kybdobris Koderieus Ankyrieus Xantomoulis.’

You say these things when He appears threateningly, in order that He might be
placated and speak about the things you ask.

When the rite is ended, the road back to the Black Cube can be opened with

these words:

Anaea  Ocheta  Thalamnia  Keri-Deu  /  Koirapsia  Genechrona  Sanelon  Sty-
Gardes Chleido Phrainole Paidolis laei,  Depart to your rest, my lord, master
of the world, forefather; go to your own places in order that the universe
be maintained. Be gracious to me, lord.'

144

To Summon Saturn - Variant I
This  is one of the three great rites to draw on the power of the  Black Cube.

This rite is something of a catch-all, as the author of the original grimoire
wrote  it in  such  a way that the  magician  can  add their own  particular needs.
This rite is distinct from the two which follow it by virtue of the fact that it is
essentially bloodless  and does  not require  (or even  recommend)  the  sacrifice
of a living or dead animal. As with  any particular ritual to call on  Saturn, the
magician  is  recommended to  remember  that  Saturnine  magic  can  be  a very
double-edged sword.

The  Rite34
When you address Saturn, dress yourself in black. Betake yourself to the prop-
er place on Saturday, having in hand an iron ring, and take with you a censor
in  which  you  place  charcoal  burning with  incense.  [Recipe  of incense  found
earlier on p. 136f.]. Having fumigated the shrine, speak thus:

'Oh great master who possesses a great name and who is situated above
all  planets,  you  who  is  placed  high  and  in  an  elevated  place.  You  are
the  Lord  Saturn,  cold  and  dry,  shadowy,  author  of good,  true  in  your
friendship,  sincere  in your  promises,  persistent  and tenacious  in your

34  Adapted from the Latin Picatrix, Book III.

145

friendships  and  enmities,  of tenacious  and  profound  intellect,  true  in
your  sayings  and  your  promises,  unique  in  your  operations,  isolate,
apart  from  the  other  gods,  with  sorrow  and  suffering,  distant  from
mindless  pleasure. You are the old one,  the ancient,  at once wise and a
destroyer of good judgement, you mix good and evil.  Sad and unhappy
is he who vexes you, happy is he whom you favor. In you is placed virtue
and  power,  a  spirit  of doing  good  and evil.  I  demand,  father  and lord,
by your high names and your marvellous actions to do for me  [nn]  I call
you by your names, oh Heylil, you in the seventh heaven: Zuhal (Arabic),
Saturn (Latin), Keyvan (Persian), Chronos  (Greek), Sacas  (India).'

This rite, as the one that precedes it,  is intended to call on the power of the

Saturnine  deity  for  whatever  reasons  the  magician  requires.  This  vari-
ant,  from the  same  manuscript  (The Picatrix)  as  the  previous  one,  follows the
same general format. The magician must fumigate the shrine with Saturnine
incense, then chant the spell. Afterwards, however, the ritual text requires the
sacrifice of a black goat.

The  Rite35
Begin the ritual at the shrine. Make sure your incense is in an iron brazier. After
censing the shrine, the magician should recite the following incantation:

In  the  name  of C haos,  In  the  Name  of ashbeel  the  mandatory king  of
Saturn in all the cold and ice, the Owner of the Seventh Orbit,  I call you
with all your names: in Arabic zuhal, in Persian kiwan, in Roman, satur-
nus,  coronis  in Greek, and in Indian  shanshar.  In the name of the God
of the Upper Structure,  accept my request and accept my call and obey
the God of the Dominion and make my request [nn]  come true.

35  Adapted from the Ouroboros Picatrix, Book III, p. 72.

146

Then you praise  Chaos,  and you present  a  sacrifice  for  Saturn. Traditionally,
the sacrifice was a black goat, which was slaughtered, and its liver cooked and
eaten by the magician or beneficiary of the ritual. Alternatively, the contempo-
rary magician  might purchase  a goat or cow liver from  a butchery,  offer it to
the god, and then cook and eat it.

Variant I I I

The  third  of  the  great  rites  to  summon  Saturn  is  derived  from  Ibn

Wahshiyya's Nabataean Agriculture. This ritual comes from an older textual
tradition than the two other Saturnine rites recorded in The Picatrix. It requires
a sacrifice of carrion,  namely dead bats and mice.  Ibn Wahshiyya reports that
he  himself (supposedly a Muslim)  has  made  use  of its  spell and finds  it to be
effective. This spell comes with several warnings, which suggest that humility
is one of the keys to its success.

The  Rite36
It is best to perform this ritual when  Saturn is in an auspicious celestial posi-
tion, otherwise his negative influence may ruin the desired result of the ritual.
First,  kindle  a  small  sacred  fire  before  His  shrine.  Next,  into  the  sacred  fire,
offer  pieces  of old  leather,  covered  in  grease  and  blood.  When  the  fire  has
burned  down,  then  gather  the  ashes.  Smearing  the  ashes  on  your  face  and
hands,  you  should  bow  low  to  Saturn's  shrine,  or  else  towards  a  black  cube
on black cloth or sand. As  Saturn is a grim and sinister god,  it is  necessary to
show great humility when asking Him for favors.  Yet He is magnanimous, like
all  kings,  and  rewards  displays  of humility with  great  generosity.  Recite  the
prayer below in a low tone.

I address myself to Saturn,  standing,  I ask and I honor You with obedi-
ence  and  humility;  I  address  Him,  standing  and  facing  the  exalted

36  Adapted from N abataean Agriculture, pp. 141-145.

147

master,  alive  and eternal,  solid in  His  power and dominion.  He is  eter-
nal  in  his  heaven  and  mighty  in  His  dominion,  focused  in  His  efforts
and His great works. He is over all, His power is over all living things on
earth,  and they endure by His endurance.  By His power and His might
He began them, and He causes them to continue; He causes us to endure,
and by His eternity and perpetuity,  He brings permanence on earth. By
His  might,  He causes the waters to ebb and flow.  Living,  He causes life
to move, because He is himself alive.

He is cold, as is His nature. Through the influence of His high realm, the
trees grow, and the earth becomes heavy under the weight of His move­
ments; if He wishes,  He causes beings to become what they are not. Yet
He  is  wise  and  a  creator  by  His  might  and  intelligence;  His  Knowing
extends to all things.

Hail,  lord of the heavens,  may Your name be  holy,  pure  and honored.  I
obey You; I address myself to Your ancientness, I call You by Your names,
Your ancientness, Your nobility and honor.  I demand from You whom I
respect to strengthen my mind, that it be strong and enduring and dwell
in me while I live. Then when I die, ward off the worms and reptiles from
my flesh. You are a merciful and ancient teacher, and no one can save the
one You condemn. You are persistent in Your words and deeds, and You
regret not Your acts. You are slow and profound in your powers. You are
a  master whose  deeds  cannot be  undone,  and what You  forbid cannot
be done by another. You are respected in all Your actions and unique in
Your kingdom. You are the lord of the other planets,  and the very stars
fear the sound of your movement and tremble before Your gaze.

I  ask and demand You to  avert Your  evil  from  me,  and  in Your  purity,
to treat me well.  By Your good and noble names,  I avert Your evil,  and I
draw from Your virtue.  By Your names,  by Your True  Name which You
love more than the others, treat me well and grant [nn].'

148

The B lack Cube

This  ritual has  a very simple  incantation,  but the  preparation  is  somewhat

challenging.  It  requires  the  creation  of a cube with  an  iron  base,  and the
inscription of Saturnine names into the sides. A sacrifice is then made, and the
magician  can  make  his  request.  This  spell does  not  summon  Saturn  directly,
but rather draws on the power of His component souls.

The  Rite37
To  ask  a  specific  need  of Saturn  you  need  to  approach  Him  when  the  Sun
descends to Capricorn's sign or the Moon is in Sagittarius.

■   You make a cube (preferably of iron) and put on it colored clothes,

green, black and red.38
Inscribe the names Tus (Top), Khrus (Bottom), Ciyus (Right), Diriyus
(Left), Tamus (Front), Dorus (Back) on the Cube.

■

■   Then take the cube to the desert under a fruitless tree. Alternatively,
bring it to a desolate place with little vegetation. This could be an
abandoned factory, or the wilderness, or a graveyard. You must

38  The clothes here is a reference to the kisw a, the tent-like covering o f the Kaaba in Mecca.

149

bring a sacrifice of raw, bloody meat (preferably beef) and kindle a
small sacred fire.39

■   Then you say

Brimas,  Tos, Khroos, Kiyoos, Chardiyos,  Tamoos, Rtyoos, Taheed, Seyrah,
Mandool
This means, "Come spirits, this is your sacrifice.”

■   You will now present the sacrifice to the cube and burn the meat,
together with the hair of a black cat, and some carob, myrrh, and
juniper.

■   Then ask for what you desire.

39  The original rite asks to bring a calf or a cow as well as  incense made o f a black cats' brain,
its guts, carob, myrrh, juniper. The sacrifice shall then  be slaughtered as painlessly as possi-

ble and be presented to the cube.

150

T h e  R ite of  Chains

There  are  many  rites  by which  one  can  connect  to  the  Saturnine  current;

none are undertaken lightly, but some rites are heavier than others. Having
practiced the previous rituals for no less than a year, and only if a magician feels
a very strong affinity for the deity, he or she may wish to take steps to perma-
nently bind themselves to the god. Such a choice must be pondered deeply as in
order to become a true priest or priestess of the Saturnine deity, one must freely
surrender one's  own  essence  to  the  lord  of chains.  In  other words,  the  magi-
cian  must  deliberately  offer  to  the  god  his  very  soul,  as  well  as  his  personal
hopes and ambitions, as an act of sacrifice. The Saturnine deity will accept no
lesser gift as the price of admission to His inner sanctum. One does not need to
perform this ritual in order to practice the Saturnine cult, or Saturnine magic.
This  route  must  exclusively  be  taken  by  those  who  having  tasted  the  bitter-
sweet  gnosis  of the  god,  wish  to  bind  themselves  to  the  Black  Cube,  and  to
its  eternal  current.  To  the  believers  in  the  cycle  of rebirth,  this  ritual  creates
karmic  (or psychic)  chains that cannot be broken,  and commit the magician's
future selves to the service of the god. It is one thing to sip from Saturn's black
cup  of gnosis  -   it  is  another  to  drain  it  to  the  dregs.  If you  have  any doubts
about performing this rite, then do not pursue it further. Caveat cultor.

th e  rite.

■   The magician should perform the rite in a stone (not wooden) cham-
ber below ground, like a cellar or basement. Ventilation is impor-
tant, as the ritual involves fire.

■   The magician must wear black clothing, scissors, a neck-chain or
wrist-chain of steel or iron, and three scraps of black leather. The
black scraps of leather must be smeared ahead of time with the
magician's blood, urine, and sexual fluids -  this should be done
the day before, so the leather and fluids are dried by the time of
the ritual.  The magician's name must be written or carved into the
three scraps of leather.

■   Three pieces of paper should also be prepared. The first has the
name and family tree of the magician; the second contains an
account of their most vivid memories; the third has a description of
their hopes for the future.

■   A black cup of red wine should be present, and should be bitter (not

sweet) if possible.

■   For this ritual, no shrine is needed. Instead, a small fire is kindled in

a brazier facing west.

■   The room should be censed with pungent incense prior to the ritual.

The  Site
The  magician  should  begin  the  rite  by bowing  to  the  west,  then  kneeling  or
sitting before the sacred fire.

Incantation:

Lord of the West,  Who  dwells  beyond the  darkness,  hear  my call.  You
who were there before the other gods, you who rule over the living and
the  dead,  who  bind  all  beings  in  chains  and  are  lord  of fate  and time.
You who some called Saturn, other Shani, and Zuhal, You who some call
Ialdabaoth, and Kronos! Now I call you by a secret name, S o n e r o , which
gods and demons fear to say. When your dwelling is in the nether world,
you are lord over the dead. When your dwelling is in the night sky, you
are lord over the stars.  You are the master of destiny, and the gods go in
fear of you. Sun, moon, and stars bow to your will, and so now do I also.

C o m e ,  S o n e r o ,  fro m   y o u r  co ld   th ro n e .  C o m e,  lo rd   o f  th e  b la ck   cu be,

a n d   a c c e p t  th is  sa c rific e   fro m   y o u r  tru e   d a u g h te r/so n .  To  Y o u ,  lo rd ,  I

o ffe r  all.

Magician  takes  the  first pieces  of leather and paper  and offers them  into the
fire. They imagine their soul/name/essence being consumed.

Lord,  I  [name  of magician]  freely  offer  you  my  name,  my  being,  my
essence.

Magician  takes  the  second  pieces  of leather  and  paper,  and offers  them  into
the  fire.  They imagine their past life,  their memories,  and their  relationships
being consumed by the fire.

Father, I offer you my past, my memories, my victories and failures.

Magician takes the third pieces of leather and paper, and offers them into the
fire. They imagine their possible future choices and chances being consumed.

Master, I offer you my future, my dreams and hopes.

153

The magician takes the scissors, and cuts a small piece of his hair.  This should
be offered into the fire.

My flesh and blood are yours to command. While you are bound to your
throne,  I  shall be your ears and eyes. When you command,  I  shall serve
as your hand in this world, according to your whim.

The magician takes the cup of bitter wine in both hands.

Your  truth  is  the  only truth  that  I  seek.  With your  eyes  I  will  see,  and
with your ears will  I  hear.  The  past and present shall be known to me,
for  I  am  a  priest/ess  of the  Saturnine  deity.  Speak  to  me,  tell  me your
secrets.

The  magician  drains  the  cup  to  its  dregs.  Then,  they should meditate  on  the
Saturnine deity in whatever form seems best to them. If the ritual is performed
correctly, they will receive  gnosis directly from the god. This will be  personal,
and should not be shared. After the period of meditation and the reception of
gnosis, the new priest/ess takes the chain  and binds  it on their neck or wrist,
saying:

Your  chains  have  freed  me  from  karma.  By  night,  I  have  become  the
bearer of chaos into the world.  By day,  I have become a bringer of your
new order. I have taken your chains upon myself, and shall go forth as an
agent of the Black Throne.

Be well,  Lord and Father, and be pleased with me, now and always.

The magician should bow low to the west, and extinguish the flame.  He should
leave the chamber, bath, and retire for the night.  Any dreams should be record-
ed, if possible, as they may be significant.

Concluding Remarks

With roots  stretching back into antiquity, the Cult of the  Black Cube has

celebrated the  Saturnine deity under many names and in many places.
Even today we  still acknowledge  the  living  Saturnine traditions  in  India and
within the Afro-Caribbean currents.  I hope to have shown with this work that
there is a very rich corpus of Saturnine rites and ceremonies recorded in medi-
eval and classical texts, which  provide  a window into  how many of the  great
cultures of the world understood this powerful deity. Saturn is feared, not only
because He is a deity, or because of His association with death and the under-
world, but because He represents the aspect of Chaos that remains within the
cosmos.  Chaos  is  depicted  in  many  ancient  creation  myths,  and  it  seems  to
serve two predominant roles.

First, Chaos is life -  it is the generative, primordial darkness from which the
cosmos emerges. Chaos is a kind of parent, even referred to as the "mother" of
the Archons in some of the Gnostic traditions. Chaos is not inimical to life; but
it is not alive or aware of life in the same  sense that we  (or even the gods)  are.
The  generations  of Chaos  can  be  monstrous  and dangerous,  and  give  rise  to
stories about asuras, Titans, and other terrors that plague early civilization.

Second,  Chaos  is  opposed by other  spiritual  powers,  and demonized  as  a
monster  itself.  This  role  is  exemplified  in  Christian  legends, which  prophesy
a coming final battle  in which Chaos will return to war against Creation. The

155

cosmos  is  disturbed,  and  the  earth  groans  with  storms,  earthquakes,  even
eclipses, all caused by the increasing intrusions of Chaos. Most of these legends
predict a return of the very monsters that appeared in the earlier battles at the
dawn  of creation:  dragons  and demons  break their adamantine  chains -  and
so  too,  perhaps,  the  Saturnine  deity. Whether  or  not  such  legends  should be
taken literally,  it illustrates that there are other powers in the cosmos besides
Chaos, and that these powers seek to limit and marginalize the cosmos as best
they can.

Saturn  as  an  agent or remnant of Chaos within the  cosmos  is  opposed by
the  other  gods  but they cannot  slay him.  This  leads  to  His  exile  but  Saturn's
godly prison is imperfect. His malefic influence remains perennial, and erupts
at times to temporary riotous freedom, before it can be banished back into the
black dimension symbolized by the cube.

The perceptive Saturnine acolyte sees the black deity not only as a god, but
as a symbol of the Chaos which He embodies. In other words, the veneration of
Saturn is the veneration of an extension of Chaos itself. The Saturnine path is
a dark one, not because it is inherently bad or hateful, but because it is aligned
with forces that are alien to most other spiritual currents. The Saturnine adept
challenges the ruling powers of this aeon, just as the Saturnine Deity disrupts
those powers in myth, and likewise in reality.

The  dark  deity  has  two  essential  goals,  which  form  the  mandate  of the
Saturnine cult. The  first goal is to claim sovereignty, to conquer, to take back
the  celestial throne  and then  to  restore  the  Saturnine  kingdom  ensuing  in  a
state in which the world is again less differentiated from Chaos. Under Saturn's
rule, humanity would be free of fear,  grief,  and loss, because it would achieve
true equality through its newfound freedom from individuality and discrimi-
nation, in a never-ending Saturnalia.

The  second,  more  far-reaching goal,  is the  eventual return  of Chaos  itself.
The Saturnine kingdom may never return -  there are no guarantees, and there
are other  spiritual powers  that hold sovereignty,  or would like to  seize  it. Yet
the  return  of Chaos  is  prophesized,  and when  it comes,  it may be  for the last
time. The  Saturnine acolyte prepares  for that day,  by working to  increase the
influence of Saturn -  and Chaos -  at work in the world today.

156

On  a  personal  level,  the  Saturnine  current  is very empowering.  This  path
offers rites and devotional practices that lead to genuine gnosis, and to greater
control  of one's  life  and  surroundings.  This  is  an  esoteric  system  that  genu-
inely produces miracles -  the medieval authors risked their lives  (and reputa-
tions)  to tell us  as  much.  Devotion to the  god of malefica brings  resilience to
many kinds of harm. Allegiance to the deity of restraint brings freedom from
many of the esoteric and mundane shackles that bind others. Yet the Saturnine
current is connected to the Saturnine cause, and anyone who genuinely seeks
to enter the current will find that their ambitions  and drives take  a back seat
to the greater will of the deity of the Black Cube. As Saturnine gnosis begins to
build within an individual, one becomes an agent of Chaos, and that may bring
with  it a certain  degree of unforeseen hardship.  This  sounds  dramatic,  but it
is unavoidable, because the Saturnine path is part of an actual drama, an epic
which is yet to be finished.

This book was written at the urging of the Black Cube, in the hopes that its
content may be of use to others who feel drawn to the presence of this strange
deity.  Saturn  offers  you  the  chance  to  stand  with  Him  while  living,  so  that
you  may have  a  hand  in  shaping your  own  destiny.  As  Saturn  is  Himself an
aspect of Chaos,  He offers you the opportunity to allow Chaos to run rampant
in your life,  even  if only for a little while.  The  Saturnine  path  is truly unique,
because it brings  genuine communion with a deity that is  alien to this world,
yet constrained by it. By making common cause with Saturn, you are allowing
yourself a chance to actually know Him, and in serving Him, to serve yourself.

B ibliography of Saturnine M aterials

The  following  section  examines  a  selection  of  easily  accessible  primary

and  secondary  sources  that  include  details  of the  Saturnine  deity  and
its  cult  particularities. A cursory examination  of the  list  reveals  how broadly
the  Saturnine deity was revered.  It should be noted that this list is very much
abbreviated, rather than exhaustive.

Tezcatlipoca,  ‘L o rd  o f  the S m o k in g  M ir r o r'. Trans. Michel Besson.
University Press of Colorado, 2003.

Olivier's  work  is  the  definitive  study  on  the  cult  of Tezcatlipoca,  the  Aztec
analog  of the  Saturnine  deity.  This  volume  contains  myths,  semiotics,  and
cultic  practices which  are  adaptable for the  contemporary practitioner of the
Meso-American current of the Black Cube. Despite the general disappearance
of much of the Meso-American culture, Tezcatlipoca's cult continues today to
be a popular force in contemporary occultism. This study is especially important,

159

because  it examines  a culture which  exalts  the  Saturnine  deity as  paramount,
rather than attempting to revere yet restrain the deity, as in Roman culture.

■   Elizabeth Baquedano. Tezcatlipoca: T rickster a n d  S u p re m e  D eity,

University Press of Colorado, 2014.

Baquedano's  work  is  an  absolute  must,  as  it  builds  on  the  foundation  of the
work  by Olivier,  but  considers  the  last  decade's  worth  of research,  and  most
significantly, it weighs all through the lens of archeology and material culture.
Considering ritual, sacrificial, and burial items, Baquedano is able to construct
a more complete understanding of the Saturnine cult than has been previously
possible.

This  article  explains  some  of  the  spiritual  and  scrying  practices  of  the
Tezcatlipoca cult  (among others).  It details the use  of iron  mirrors,  as well as
the use of entheogens as part of the shamanic experience. This article is espe-

scrying and astral projection practices.

CLASSICAL /  MEDIEVAL

■   Betz. Th e G reek M a g ic a l P a p y ri. Greek and Demotic, circa 5 th century ce,

Egypt-

The Greek Magical Papyri  (Papyri Graecae Magicae or p g m )  need little introduc-
tion for the literate occultist. A collection of primarily Greek and Demotic texts,
the  pgm  is  a thorough  Hellenistic  series  of spells,  prayers,  and  rituals,  which
provides  the  basis  for what  is  considered the  Hermetic  tradition.  A blend  of
Jewish, early Christian,  Hellenistic (Greco-Roman), Egyptian, and other tradi-
tions from antiquity, the  pgm  collection is diverse in its content and dating, as

160

it contains  materials  from as early as the  second century b c e ,  to as late as the
5th century c e . While the Satunine deity is not prevalent in this corpus, Cronos
appears  in  several  incantations,  most noticeably an  oracle  rite  that  is  said to
summon the Titan himself.

■   Macrobius. T h e S a tu rn a lia. Latin, 5 th century c e , Rome.
Macrobius  Ambrosius  Theodosius  was  a  fifth  century  Roman  writer,  whose
work Saturnalia tells us  much of what we understand around the practices  of
the Saturnalia festival, which begins on 17 December. He describes the strange
practices  of the  festival,  focusing on the  positive chaotic  aspects,  the  reversal
of roles,  and customs  relevant to  its  correct celebration. Through  Macrobius,
we understand also  some  of the  larger cult of Saturn,  and his worship  in  the
pre-Republic period. At the time of writing,  his works  are not yet available in
English, and require Latin.

■   H. S. Versnel, T ra n sitio n  a n d  R ev e rsa l in  M y th  a n d  R it u a l Inconsistencies

in  G reek a n d  R o m a n  R elig io n  II. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1993.

Versnel's pioneering work on the Greco-Roman's cults of Cronos and Saturn is
absolutely fundamental to the contemporary cult of the Black Cube. It discuss-
es interpretation of myth, and the cultic and sacerdotal practices of the cult of
the Saturnine deity. One of the salient details of this volume is that while other
studies often assume that Cronos = Saturn and therefore separate discussion
is  unnecessary,  Vernel wisely  acknowledges  the  distinction  between  Cronos
and  Saturn,  and  treats  each  'persona'  of the  deity  as  unique.  The  Saturnalia
and the  Cronia  are  even  treated  in  separate  chapters.  This  is  not  to  say that
the author does not recognize the cultic connections or borrowing, but that he
understands that Roman religion was distinct from Greek religion, despite the
evident borrowings which took place. This work is also important as it does not
shy away from some of the darker, chthonic aspects of the Saturnine deity, and
explores  (for example)  the bloodier sacrificial aspects  of the 'fearful and even
horrible  god.'  Finally,  Versnel  discusses  the  Roman  spouse  of Saturn,  Mater
Lua ('Mother Destruction'), who often receives little attention despite her rela-
tively sinister character.

This work is a solid academic overview of a wide range of medieval magic, from
diverse  sources  (eastern  and western).  It  includes  several  examples  of medi-
eval  Saturnine  magical operations,  which  give  some  insight  into how  Saturn
was perceived by the practicing medieval European magician. This text tends
towards what practitioners  at that time would have considered 'black magic,'
as it antedates the modern understanding and discussion of Right Hand Path/
Left  Hand  Path  (rhp/lhp)  which  has  become  common  parlance  in  western
esoteric tradition.

Planet Sani (Saturn) in Southeast India." in Studies in South Indian
Civilization in Honour of  Velcheru Narayana Rao. Ed. David Shulman.
Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1995 .

This  essay  provides  a very  good overview of contemporary popular  devotion
to  Saturn  (Sani)  in  South Asia,  and  is  especially  good at  understanding  how
such an overtly malefic deity is rehabilitated in the popular consciousness. The
essay provides a very good introduction to the dating of the navagraha cult as
far back as the Vedic period. The essay explores the  major contemporary folk
beliefs about Saturn, such as his fearsome nature, his generally negative influ-
ence, the duration of his overshadowing  (in years), the positive aspects of the
trauma He inflicts, and the means by which his black gaze can be mitigated.

■   Robert Svoboda. The Greatness of  Saturn: A Therapeutic Myth. Lotus

Press: 1997

This  short book is  Dr.  Robert Svoboda's work on  Lord Sani,  the Vedic equiva-
lent of Saturn. Better known for his work on the Aghora sect of India, Svoboda
here  explores  and  adapts  some  of the  traditional  Saturnine  legends  for  a
Western  audience.  As  a  master  jyotisha  (astrologer),  Svoboda  is  concerned

162

with Sani principally as one of the navagraha or 'astral seizers', and that is the
lens through which Saturn is explored in this book.  Svoboda is not concerned
with  describing  the  ancient  Saturnine  cults,  as  he  is  a  practitioner  and yogi
rather  than  a  historian.  Nevertheless,  he  includes  some  very  practical  notes
for  how  to  incorporate  Saturnine  devotion  into  one's  spiritual  routine.  It  is
good to note that in this work Svoboda explores the concept of Saturn  as the
principle of restraint, which corresponds very nicely to the Western imagery of
Saturn as 'the chained god.'

■   Charles Burnett. ‘Remarques Paléographiques et Philologiques sur les
noms d'anges et d'esprits dans les traités de magie traduits de l'arabe
en latin' in Mélanges de l'Ecole française de Rome, Tome 114 (2002).

This  brief pamphlet  is  largely unknown,  yet very significant  for its  combina-
tion of Arabic, Indian, and Latin themes. Its principal value is the transmission
of some  alleged  Saturnine  tradition  from  India,  together with  a  detailed list
of the 72 'spirits' of Saturn in Arabic and Latin texts. Burnett in turns cites the
Arabic Kitab al-Ustuwwatas and Kitab al-Istimatis manuscripts as texts contain-
ing  Saturnine  materials. While  the  scripts  involved are Arabic  and  Latin,  the
transmission is clearly Indian in origin.

ISLAMIC

■   Pseudo Al-Majriti. Ghayat al Hakim ('The Aim of the Sage') / The
Picatrix (Latin title). Arabic, circa 11th century c e , Andalusia.

The Ghayat al Hakim  (Arabic for 'Aim of the  Sage')  is  a well-attested text from
10th/11th  century  Andalusia.  It  was  composed  in  Arabic,  and  later  translated
into  Spanish  and  Latin  as  The  Picatrix.  It  is  among  the  best  known  Islamic
esoteric  texts  in  the  Western  world.  The  author,  sometimes  referred  to  as
Pseudo Al-Majriti,  presents  the  text  as  applied 'philosophy,'  and it contains  a
sizable transmission of astrological and talismanic lore, which has been traced
ultimately  to  Harran  (Turkey),  and  contains  practices  that  are  Hermetic/
Hellenistic,  Sabian,  Nabataean,  and even  Indian.  While  The  Picatrix is  some-
times cited as the definitive work on Arab astrology, it is important to note that

163

its fame in Islamic countries was relatively minor when compared with better
known works like the Shams ul-Ma‘arifa.  The Picatrix is  an excellent source on
ancient  and  medieval  Saturnine  practices  in  the  Muslim  world  and  beyond,
as the author includes a very generous range of Saturnine practices and anec-
dotes on the various names, attributes, powers, and cultic practices specific to
Zuhal.

■   Abu Bakr Ibn Wahshiyya. F ila h a  a l-N a b a t iy y a  ('Nabataean

Agriculture'). Arabic, circa 9 th century c e , Iraq.

Nabataean Agriculture was  a work  penned by the  ninth century c e  author Abu
Bakr  A'mad  bin  Ali  al-Nabati,  an  Iraqi  scholar  and  mystic.  Ibn  Wahshiyya's
works have not been fully translated into English, and require reading knowl-
edge  of Arabic.  He  was  something  of a  polymath,  and wrote  about  alchemy,
poisoning,  history,  linguistics,  and  the  ancient  agricultural  and  spiritual
practices  of the  pre-Islamic  peoples  of Mesopotamia.  Ibn  Wahshiyya's  work
Nabataen Agriculture does indeed cover some facets of farming, but also includes
several very detailed prayers and cult practices of Zuhal. Ibn Wahshiyya's notes
are,  in fact,  so highly detailed that they indicate that he himself practiced the
cultic rites of the  Saturnine deity, though he takes pains to inform the reader
that he includes such instructions 'only for posterity.' The Nabataean Agriculture
was  in turn one of several sources  for the anonymous  author of the  Ghayat al
Hakim.

■   Anon. R a s a ’il Ik h w a n  a l-S a fa   ('Epistles of the Brethren of Purity').

Arabic, circa 1 0 th c e n t u r y  c e , Iraq.

The Epistles form 52 separate books,  and are  sometimes  rightly referred to  as
an  encyclopedia.  They  are  the  works  of an  elite  Muslim  intellectual  society,
which  appears  to  have  embraced  a  very  wide  range  of views  that  included
Hermetic,  Ismaili,  Sufi, and Neo-Platonic ideologies. When we describe them
as 'Muslim,' we mean largely that their members would have publicly self-iden-
tified as Muslims,  and that the movement's members were living in predomi-
nantly Muslim territory. This said, a thorough study of their works (the Epistles
most notably)  indicates  some  esoteric views  that would have  been  heterodox

164

and illegal by both Sunni and Shi'a standards. Additionally, the Epistles (specifi-
cally volume 52)  include  some cult practices of Zuhal,  as well as the initiation
rites  of a chthonic  cult that worshipped an entity known  as the  Demogorgon
(Arabic 'Girgis'). These have been partially translated into English, and Oxford
is completing a complete bilingual edition.

Tim e,  the W a tch m a k e r God,  a n d  F a th e r C h ristm a s. Athens: University of
Georgia Press, 1987.

This volume is useful for several reasons.  First,  it explores the  Saturn-Cronus
figure as the god (or aeon) of time, which is one of the principal aspects of the
deity. Secondly, it examines how those cultural aspects have survived in differ-
ent,  more  benevolent  guises,  such  as  Father  Time  and  (unexpectedly)  Santa
Claus. The value of this text is that it demonstrates how the mimetic aspect of
a deity may visibly survive through several cultural shifts, without diminishing
its popularity or influence.  Mace/s work is less useful as  a practical text,  and
provides more understanding of the deity than (say) its cult or practices.
